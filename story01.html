	<b><a name="T4">Our Values</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
<b>AltSchool is 100% focused on our students.
</b><br><br>
Our personalized learning approach puts each child at the center of everything we do. 
Smaller classroom student:teacher ratios, coupled with state-of-the-art classroom design and technology, enable a flexible learning environment that mixes individual, group and experiential learning. 
<br><br>
<b>AltSchool is dynamic. 
</b><br><br>

Our analytical approach and core strengths in innovation combine educational best practices with the latest tools. Our educators build learning experiences that are adaptive at their core and keep our children engaged. 
<br><br>
<b>AltSchool is rigorous严格.
</b><br><br>

Students learn best when they are interested. By personalizing learning to student needs and passions, we can challenge them more. Students learn at a level that pushes them, but not so much that they disengage揭开/脱离. We also provide frequent quantitative and qualitative feedback to ensure that students are prepared for success after their AltSchool years. 
<br><br>
<b>AltSchool is diverse.
</b><br><br>
We believe that children benefit from diversity and that all children deserve值得 an excellent, child-centered education. 
<br><br>

<b>AltSchool is engaged with the community.
</b>
<br><br>
Learning is not just about what happens inside the classroom. We connect students with experts and institutions in the community to enrich the learning experience and keep them wanting more. 
<br><br>
<b>AltSchool is a partnership.
</b><br><br>
We believe it is vital to have parents integrally involved in their child’s education. We measure parent satisfaction and offer tools so that parents can see and understand how their students are learning at any point in time - not just at parent/teacher conferences. <br><br>

<b>AltSchool is fun.
</b><br><br>
When students drive their own learning, they become motivated by passion and creativity -- and learn to be that way throughout their lives. They also simply love going to school. We love watching them show up early on Mondays, ready to dive right in. 
<br><br>

	<b><a name="T5">Our Parents</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
That said, parents have busy lives -- so AltSchool makes it easy for them to stay involved and informed. Through simple technology solutions for communication, registration, payments and permission slips, AltSchool helps families spend more time on the things that matter most -- and that most benefit their children. 
<br><br>
AltSchool works with families on after-school care 托管班 and transportation options to make school convenient. Scheduling constraints due to additional commitments can be accommodated and family travel is encouraged as an opportunity for children to learn outside the classroom. <br><br>

AltSchool parents are integral to the <b>reimagined school experience</b>. AltSchool looks to them for feedback on what is going well and what can be improved. Aside from simply listening, AltSchool explicitly measures different dimensions of parent satisfaction, sharing the results in a transparent way and tracking progress over time. 
<br><br>
AltSchool has an open door policy and welcomes parents to the classroom. However, volunteer hours are not requested or required. AltSchool has a full team working in the background so that parents don't have to worry about mandatory volunteering<br><br>
