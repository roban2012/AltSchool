	古之学者为己，今之学者为人。我们用心做，您来细细品。您也可以<a href= "http://www.retter2012.com" title="点击进入"> 先下载一个</a>应用程序（App），有空再慢慢看。<br><br>
	
At AltSchool, we’re always looking to learn from parents. Their hopes and desires directly impact the decisions we make. 
<br><br>
The process of understanding parents begins when they learn about AltSchool at our info sessions. Using a human-centered design approach, we ask parents: 
 <br><br>
What type of education will best prepare your children for 2030？ <br><br>

Parents write their answers on post-it notes. We read and discuss their responses during the session.
<br><br>
Hundreds of parents and post：its later, we have a pretty broad spectrum of responses.

<br><br>



So, what do parents tell us？<br><br>

Using a wonderful little tool called Wordle, we made a word cloud of parent responses: 
<br><br>
<a href= "pic01.html">What type of education will best prepare your children for 2030 </a><br><br>


Bigger words indicate more mentions. In this word cloud, “global" and “technology” are most prominent, but there’s more to it than that. Let’s dig deeper into what parents tell us when they mention these two words.
<br><br>




硅谷 Technology is clearly important to prepare children for 2030, but we know parents don’t just want technology for its own sake. Parents say they want an education that: <br><br>
--“integrates technology, not as an add-on"<br><br>
--“empowers students to incorporate the ever-changing world of technology”<br><br>
--“[encourages] creative consumption of technological resources”<br><br>

These answers are exactly in line with our principles. At AltSchool, we believe it’s critical to be thoughtful about the use of technology and not just deploy it for the sake of having the latest gadgets. Our technology never replaces teachers: it supports them. <br><br>




For example, we’re building digital platforms to allow teachers to create Personalized Learning Plans for every student. 
<br><br>
We’re also creating technology to help parents feel involved in their children’s education - something we’ve heard is extremely important to our current and prospective families. 
<br><br>
Finally, we complement our interactive, project--based approach in the classroom with digital learning tools that are carefully curated by our educators as part of each student’s plan.
<br><br>
We also know a global education is important to parents. We provide opportunities for students to learn about international culture and events, whether they’re celebrating Dia de los Muertos or collecting children’s items for Typhoon Haiyan relief. AltSchool students also have Spanish instruction via Skype with a teacher from Ecuador. We’ll be adding Mandarin 普通话 next year.<br><br>


We recognize the value in the long-tail answers, too. Looking at answers that didn’t make it into the word cloud, we found the following skills mentioned:<br><br>

--“Understand the value of day-dreaming and how to apply it”<br><br>
--“Find solutions where others stopped looking"<br><br>
--“Understand very complex systems, like food, water, and technology markets”<br><br>


Discussion of these skills is already creating a buzz匆忙 around our classroom. <br><br>

Of course, what parents write on post--its is only a small piece of our design process. We incorporate parents, teachers, and students into all parts of our development to continuously improve the <b>learning experience</b>.  
<br><br>
Join us at our next info session to be a part of our ongoing collaboration for a better education.
