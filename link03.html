Our passion for re-imagining education informs what we do every day, whether it's building innovative new technology tools for the classroom, connecting with communities of parents and students to learn how we can meet their needs, or recruiting the best talent for our team. <br><br>

<b>Education Team 
</b><br><br>
Our educators bring years of experience from diverse backgrounds including public and private school, and traditional and progressive models. We believe that in order to transform education, we must change the culture around how we support teachers. <br><br>
<b>Head of School 
</b><br><br>
The Head of School is responsible for building the local AltSchool micro-school by leading an on-site team of educators and by establishing site-specific culture, scheduling, processes, and procedures. Heads of School nurture the professional development of school-site team members. They also build and maintain positive, transparent relationships with the micro-school’s parents, and support other educators to do the same. <br><br>
Classroom Educators <br><br>

AltSchool teachers collaborate with researchers, designers, technologists, and educators alike to design and refine our innovative model for school education. Classroom educators co-teach small, mixed-age classes with low student-teacher ratios. They are responsible for designing experiential, project-based learning activities for the class by using local resources to create an experience that’s relevant to the real world. Teachers curate individual learning activities for personalized learning time based on each student’s abilities, needs, and learning style. And most importantly, teachers determine each student’s academic and social-emotional learning objectives and ensure that they’re met. <br><br>
<b>Education Support 
</b><br><br>
Education Support is a service organization within AltSchool. The primary role of Ed Support is to assure that educators have what they need to help all students reach their full potential. Ed Support provides guidance and assistance to all of AltSchool in areas including educational philosophy, research and practice, school culture, learning differences (including behavior, challenges, and giftedness), parent relations, educator mentorship, and teaching practice. Ed Support is a flexible organization which responds quickly to student, teacher, and family needs. <br><br>
<b>Co-Curriculars 辅助课程
</b><br><br>
Our co-curricular team includes full-time integration lead educators who both support an interdisciplinary curriculum during the school day and manage a team of part-time specialists who teach co-curricular classes before and after the school day. Co-curricular specialists are experts in their disciplines who work closely with dedicated classroom teachers on both axes of T-shaped learning, exposing students to new content and allowing them to dive deep into their existing passions. <br><br>

<b>PED Team: Product, Engineering, and Design </b>
<br><br>
The Product, Engineering, and Design (PED) team is made up of talented individuals working to craft a 21st century operating system to power the AltSchool personalized learning model. Our software applications and hardware tools serve four distinct user groups - students, teachers, parents, and the AltSchool Operations team - yet work together seamlessly. The unique challenges that we face in this endeavor create opportunities to flex our creative and analytical skills on a variety of products, such as our student activity playlist, teacher workflow dashboard, and parent app. 
<br><br>
PED includes hardware and software engineering, product management, design, and user experience research. <br><br>
<b>Corporate: Legal, HR, and Finance 
</b><br><br>
AltSchool has deliberately inverted its organizational chart to ensure a responsive, user-focused organization. At the tip of our inverted organizational pyramid, the Corporate team functions as the glue that holds our company together. Our collaborative team of administrative, finance, legal, and people operations professionals (including our executive team) strives to instill healthy business practices while ensuring that AltSchool's core business remains flexible, scalable, and always interesting. <br><br>

Corporate includes finance and accounting, legal, philanthropy and development, admin support, people operations and recruiting. <br><br>
	


<b>Ops Team: Real Estate and Admissions 
</b><br><br>
The Operations team is the engine that keeps the gears of AltSchool moving. The team ensures the satisfaction of our students, parents, and teachers, while also running our school sites and expanding our network. We engineer the day-to-day AltSchool experience from behind-the-scenes, iterating across teams throughout the company on operational strategies and processes in order to foster the best learning environment possible. As the part of our organization that is closest to students, teachers and parents, Operations owns the relationships for all of the micro-school stakeholders. 
<br><br>
Operations includes real estate and expansion, school operations, admissions, school experience, school community, satisfaction (teacher, parent and student), quality, system innovation, and safety. 
<br><br>
<b>Marketing 
</b><br><br>
The Marketing team gets the privilege of bringing the AltSchool vision to prospective parents. We are a growing team that works on a diverse range of initiatives ranging from growth-driving digital marketing to content generation to grassroots events with parents and educators. Marketers at AltSchool have the opportunity to help craft and share an educational experience that can fundamentally change the lives of children and their families. 
<br><br>
Marketing includes brand development, digital marketing, growth, content strategy, and communications.
