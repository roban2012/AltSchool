We are lucky to stand on the shoulders of incredible thinkers and doers in the education field.
<br><br>
Our approach to personalized, whole-child learning is based on decades of research and insights from educational thought leaders, such as Ellen Galinsky at the Families and Work Institute and Carol Dweck at Stanford. We also look to Tony Wagner, Howard Gardner, and Ron Ritchart (all Harvard-based scholars), as well as other bright minds committed to helping children reach their full potential.
<br><br>
Below is a short list of exceptional books that inform our educational philosophy and approach. They are sorted into three categories: Whole-Child Learning, Best Practices in Global Education, and Teaching Strategies.
<br><br>
Enjoy! We hope the ideas you read about energize and inspire you to be a part of the future of education with us.
