Posted by The AltSchool Team <br><br>

Mar 30, 2015<br><br>


The “full stack” model is a growing trend among startups. As opposed to the traditional approach of selling or licensing technology to established organizations, the full stack startup builds and manages a complete end-to-end product or service, thereby bypassing incumbents.<br><br>
 
So why take a full stack approach to education?<br><br>

“You want to own the total outcome,” says A16z General Partner and AltSchool investor, Lars Delgaard. “We are building the world’s biggest private school system. To make that experience the one we want― one that is more affordable, better, and revolutionary― you need to have full ownership.”<br><br>


In case you missed it, a16z’s podcast series hosted and moderated by Andreessen Horowitz, one of AltSchool’s investors, recently interviewed AltSchool CEO and founder Max Ventilla and Andreessen Horowitz General Partner Lars Delgaard. The pair discuss what it means to take a full stack approach to education, AltSchool’s plan for scale, and integrating technology in the classroom.<br><br>

The benefits of full stack: questioning those “sacred cows”
<br><br>
AltSchool is building schools from the ground up. And in doing so, it is re-imagining every part of the education experience, from the admissions process to curriculum balance; from the school calendar to administration costs. “If you rely on other entities to do key parts of your approach,” says Max, “then very quickly that becomes the bottleneck for the changes that you would need to make elsewhere to really improve the experience.”
<br><br>
And some of those necessary changes include reversing “sacred cows,” or unquestioned ways of doing things, within the education system. Some of these “reversals” highlighted in the A16z interview include:
<br><br>
A New Approach to Class Assessments
<br><br>
“Today standardized tests are taken at the end of the year and sit on the shelf for months,” says Max. AltSchool views assessments as critical inputs for the educational experience― they shouldn’t be done away with altogether, but instead optimized and used in a way to promote continual improvements.
<br><br>
“Assessments should instead be close to real-time, non-invasive, as accurate as possible, and provides input to that teacher, student, and parents to make improvements on what’s working and what we can change.” When engaged correctly, assessments can empower teachers, students, parents and schools with actionable data to quickly understand and make improvements throughout the year.
<br><br>
Empowering Teachers Through Technology
<br><br>
AMP_AltSchool_FM-2015-01-14-0116A major challenge for teachers today is the time spent on creating individual lesson plans for the specifics of each class― what Max calls “bespoke, artisanal lesson planning.” And though timely, this artisanal approach is necessary to navigate the complexities of teaching to a unique set of students and within specific school schema.<br><br>

One way AltSchool hopes to empower teachers is to provide them with a technological platform that makes it easier for them to share and use best practices across teacher networks. The goal is to create an operating system that makes all other elements of teaching easier, like communicating with parents and the administration, more effectively personalizing curriculum to each student, and sharing best practices with others.
<br><br>
“Teachers continually contribute to the product,” says Lars. “All the teachers have the platform, time, and incentive financially to spend time to figure out together the best [playlist] cards and education series. They continually share and build content with students so they can benefit from all the best teachers.”
<br><br>
Erasing the zero sum game realities of private schools: AltSchool’s “network effect” 
<br><br>
Limited spaces available at private schools create uncomfortable competition between families. As Max notes, “if I get my daughter into a private school, I am literally stealing a spot from someone else.” The fact that spots are limited for students in private educational institutions, creates a “value in scarcity” model― that is, there is increased value placed on selective educational experiences.
<br><br>
Whereas many private schools are deliberately not scalable― much of the value they possess is in their scarcity― AltSchool is built to scale, and get better as it scales. According to Max, “When you have something that gets better as more people participate, then you continually keep pace with the change in the world at large.”
<br><br>
AltSchool’s plan is to continually expand its network of “micro-schools” to make AltSchool increasingly available to more and more families. And by simultaneously licensing technology that helps personalize education to other schools, AltSchool has the goal of providing every child with a personalized learning experience commensurate with what 21st Century education should be.

	<hr><br>

Posted by Max Ventilla <br><br>

Ask a thousand education experts and you’ll get a thousand answers for why we still have such an outdated, underperforming model for education in this country. For us, the answer is somewhat simple - given our past and current constraints, the current model “makes sense”.<br><br>

Take your average classroom with 25 kids in it. Assume that you don’t have extraordinary resources and the children don’t necessarily all want to be there. How would you handle this? If I didn’t have any guidance, I’d probably split up the week into small chunks, perhaps 30 minutes in length, and make a plan for each window of time. I’d single out disruptive children and somehow pressure them into behaving. I’d most likely ignore the children who are disengaged but not causing problems. I’d change the scene often, every hour or so, and essentially run out the clock on the week.
 <br><br>
Over time, I’d get to know the children better. They’d trust me more and I’d learn what works better with those kids in my class. What started as chaos would become more ordered. In other words, I’d get to the point where my classroom was the best version of that model that it could be. In mathematical terms, I’d work my way up to the “local maximum” or the highest level of effectiveness, relatively speaking -- given my specific model of teaching.
<br><br>
The problem with hitting your local maximum is that it’s hard to even picture what else is out there -- you know you are at your “relative best” but you don’t know where you sit in the grand scheme. Imagine ascending a mountain in thick fog.  You work your way uphill and reach a peak C without visibility to where the next peak may be. You understand theoretically that there is a “global maximum” somewhere (a highest peak relative to all other peaks - the ultimate best way to teach, not simply the best within a single teaching model), but you have no idea which direction C or in this case, what education model -- to pursue. The only way to make it to the next peak is to break out of your current way of thinking and attempt something truly different -- an intimidating undertaking, given the 25 children that are tethered to you at the moment.<br><br>

Taking a completely different path in education is not possible for most educators. Many worry that they may “throw out the good with the bad” and disrupt elements of the school day that are actually working. They consider that perhaps the school year should be longer, for example, but that means they must figure out a way to pay teachers more, or find teachers with a different setup at home; not to mention parents with different expectations for vacation.
<br><br>
At AltSchool, we are on a continuous quest for the global maximum.  But we are carefully navigating the education frontier and checking in constantly with students, parents, and teachers to ensure we aren’t off base. We are doing our research as we go, continuously testing and measuring, and living our discoveries. While we certainly can’t say we’ve hit the peak, we are finding new local maximums regularly along the way.

	<b><a name="T3">Education as a 21st Century Good </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Max Ventilla<br><br> 

May 22, 2014<br><br>


21stCenturyEdFor centuries, the best schools have been defined by scarcity. Stanford made headlines last month for its lowest acceptance rate in history, five percent. At the K-12 level, the country’s top private schools are also known for their incredibly low acceptance rates. 
<br><br>
This is not a concept limited to education. In decades past, those who strove for the best would work hard to avoid what the ‘masses’ were doing. Every aspect of their lives -- food, clothing, entertainment, transportation -- featured possessions and services that could only be enjoyed by the elite few.  
 <br><br>
Industries’ ability to scale has changed all this. Today, scarcity increasingly fails to define what is “best.” The same Oscar-winning movies are downloaded into palatial estates and cramped apartments. The same iPhones are used by middle school children and billionaires. The privileged few may get to experience things sooner (e.g. attend a movie premiere at a festival or get the latest $499 iPhone instead of the $99 past generation model), but they are not getting something fundamentally different. Creating an exceptional experience at scale enables organizations to develop world-class products that suit the needs of all. 
<br><br>
As production becomes increasingly scientific and digital, products actually get better with scale through network effects. As markets become massive, producers invest in quality at scale and consumers benefit from a larger variety of options. By using a phone that hundreds of millions of other people use, a user gets access to a platform of applications that simply wouldn’t be built for a phone that only served a thousand uber-rich customers. The same goes for other innovative, modern products, either online like Gmail and Facebook or offline like Priuses and best selling novels. 
<br><br>
Large and open markets foster a kind of natural selection that drives iterative improvements: the better a product or service is, the more people use it. The more people use it, the better it becomes. As the network grows, we learn more about what works (and what doesn’t). Information from the network pressures the system to evolve to meet the changing needs of the people using it. Furthermore, as demand increases for each successive product, the producer can invest more in improvement. 
<br><br>
In contrast to those leading 19th century goods characterized by scarcity, our leading 21st century goods increasingly win out through scale. Consumers flock to versions of an item used by 200,000 people, rather than 200, because everything about it improves with wider distribution. 
<br><br>
The education that we have in this country is still regrettably a 19th century good. 
<br><br>
AltSchool is advancing an alternative model for education as a 21st century good.
<br><br>
We built AltSchool to get better with scale. As our micro-school network grows from hundreds to thousands to millions of enrolled students in the years and decades to come, AltSchool will transform to provide a continuously higher quality learning experience for all. This works for the same reasons as with other goods:
<br><br>
1) Every class improves as additional classes are added to the network: We test new ideas in our classrooms and share what we find with other classrooms in our network. We know that classrooms are unique and what works for one might not work for another, but with a big enough set, we can detect patterns. If the same projects are working well for a classroom in San Francisco and another in New York, those teachers, once individual workers, find benefits to collaborating on projects or teaching strategies in the future.
<br><br>
Stack2<br><br>

2) Mass customization gains efficiencies with a growing population: As more teachers create playlists and more students use them, AltSchool will better understand which playlists work best for which students. With more student trajectories, we’ll let students who exhibit similar interests, learning styles, or goals benefit from playlists that are increasingly similar. <br><br>

3) Micro-schools have the ability and pressure to evolve: Schools today have a hard time improving because educators can’t tell what’s working until long after particular practices have been put into place. Even when causal relationships are established, school systems have a built-in bureaucracy and a year-long cycle that inhibits change at a reasonable rate. This is why, for the most part, schools have not evolved much in the past hundred years. 
<br><br>
AltSchool course-corrects on at least a weekly basis so we can address what is suboptimal and double down on what shows positive results. We do not have an entrenched layer of administration staff at each micro-school, either. Instead, each classroom is independently led by a team of educators. They exchange information daily with each other and with our in-house team of designers, engineers, and researchers to improve the school experience. 
<br><br>
Natural selection is at work at AltSchool, and it is shifting our view of education in fundamental ways. While nobody can see the future, Altschool is preparing our students for the world of tomorrow by keeping up with their ever changing goals and opportunities today. By changing ourselves, we not only best serve our students; we also model for students what it means to be flexible, to take risks, and to constantly reflect.

Posted by Max Ventilla <br><br>

Mar 31, 2014<br><br>


Most weeks, I spend my time talking to parents and kids, working with technologists and teachers, and looking to new research for ways to continuously improve AltSchool. But lately, thanks to our hard work and good fortune, I’ve been speaking more to the press. <br><br>

It has been eye opening to re-enter the world in which a reimagined education isn’t the norm. I’m reminded that, to the rest of the world, education represents a long term choice among fixed options; the implicit question posed to people applying to traditional kindergartens is, “What unpersonalized school experience do you want for the next decade of your child’s life?”  <br><br>

At its heart, AltSchool is the opposite of this.<br><br>
<a href= "pic06.html">Compare AltSchool</a><br><br>


At AltSchool, because we offer a totally personalized education for every student, we can remove traditional education constraints - such as grouping children based on age or starting all children in a classroom on the same first day of school. We aren’t offering a single way of teaching or a limited package of extra-curricular activities. We aren’t even offering a single view of the school calendar or when the school day starts. Instead, we offer flexibility so that we may create the ideal experience for any family. <br><br>  
Each of our students spends the bulk of his or her classroom time working through a personalized playlist of projects and activities, curated by our teachers.  Each weekly playlist consists of fifteen to twenty cards that, together, represent the individual experiences that educate each child in the way he or she learns best in a diverse classroom setting. 
<br><br>
The plasticity and natural self-pacing allowed by the playlist approach lets us accommodate training schedules for elite athletes/artists or travel schedules for families who wish to be away outside of fixed vacation days.  We can similarly adapt to situations where the classroom teaching resources change; when one of the pair of classroom teachers is sick or when an unexpected learning opportunity (like an expert visiting the classroom) arises.   
<br><br>
Unbundling is not new -- especially for those of us coming from technology. In a classic example that shaped my career, I watched Microsoft ship software every two years while Google constantly updated its online products “under the hood.” Generally, Google’s small innovations went unnoticed, but over time products adapted by leaps and bounds -- far out-pacing Microsoft innovations.  In similar fashion -- through flexibility, performance data, and user-feedback (like the student reflections baked into each playlist card’s completion) -- AltSchool evolves and innovates on timescales that make traditional schools appear glacial in comparison.
<br><br>
Unbundling is not going away. We have no doubt that in the future, for example, instead of owning one car long term, we will choose which vehicle we need for any given situation. We’ll invest in the opportunity to have the right vehicle for commuting, heading out on a road trip, carpooling, enjoying a sunny drive, or hauling big items. We’ll compromise less and use what we need more in all the ways that most influence our standard of living (transportation, health, education, etc.). <br><br>

Education should be a flexible service rather than a fixed good in the way that software is today and that automobiles, in an era of car-sharing, are starting to be. The overall trend in the US economy is for more and more companies to offer services that change over time and that respond to the changing needs of individual consumers.  AltSchool represents that very different approach to learning that embraces change and personalization day to day and week to week, not only year to year.  Education as a service should be the norm in an Internet age and it’s our ambition at AltSchool to accelerate this transition at massive scale -- and sooner than you’d think.

Max_Ventilla_for_AltSchoolA year ago, what started as a preschool search for my daughter became a hard look at today's education options. The next thing I knew, the question of whether we'd be admitted to the right school for us became a quest to create ideal options for more parents. In starting a new school system that can scale and improve with scale, we have stood on the shoulders of giants; from both the education space and from the broader technology space around us. I am incredibly grateful for what’s been possible in twelve short months.
<br><br>
Not long after I had the idea of AltSchool, I was joined by more than a dozen world-class team-members -- child-centered educators, engineers, designers, and operations experts -- many of whom I’d had the pleasure of working with in the past. Together we opened a pilot school (in two months) that fully personalized education in a classroom setting. Since then, we’ve kept learning by doing, building technologies to better serve students, parents, and teachers. The thirty-three million dollars in Series A funding that we’re announcing today allows us to keep building AltSchool’s R&D engine, offering continuously improving, customized, whole-child learning across a growing number of AltSchools throughout the Bay Area.<br><br>
 
We are thrilled to have Founders Fund and Andreessen Horowitz lead this investment round. Their experience with transformational businesses is unmatched and, together, we are committed to bringing that passion and innovation into the world of primary education. The involvement of education heavyweights John Doerr, Jonathan Sackler, Learn Capital, and Omidyar Network underscores the contributions we can make to the school ecosystem in the U.S. and beyond. Finally, we are extremely pleased to receive substantial follow-on funding from First Round Capital and Harrison Metal, who backed us before there was much to back besides an idea and a team.
<br><br>
At AltSchool, we are mission-driven at our core. To that end, I am proud to announce that in conjunction with this fundraise, AltSchool is starting the process to become a certified B Corp. -- a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social problems. We plan to offer the best education possible for countless students over the coming decades and today marks a massive inflection in our ability to reach that goal. My sincerest thanks to the parents, students, teachers, team-members, and investors who have put their trust in AltSchool to date. We will continue to work incredibly hard to justify that trust.  <br><br>

Onwards and Altwards...

Nov 6, 2014<br><br>
It’s official -- AltSchool is expanding beyond the Bay Area, and I am thrilled to announce that our next location will be in Brooklyn, NY.<br><br>
 
A few questions have come up regarding this important step in AltSchool’s growth:
<br><br>
Why expand beyond the Bay Area?
<br><br>
With 4 locations around San Francisco, we are still new to the Bay Area, and we are excited to have built a community that will help us expand here. We continue to take advantage of all that the area has to offer us and our students, from incredible expert resources to local environments that foster AltSchool’s brand of interest driven, real-world learning. 
<br><br>
Growing around San Francisco has demonstrated the value that an expanded network affords our community, which is why its time to go beyond the Bay area. I’ve spoken and written about the importance of scale at AltSchool and how growth will help us improve the education for all of our students. For many reasons, New York -- and more specifically, Brooklyn Heights (where we also keep our east coast AltSchool office), has become the logical next step.
<br><br>

Montague Street, Brooklyn Heights. AltSchool's newest location.
<br><br>
Why Brooklyn?<br><br>

Anyone who lives around or who has spent time in Brooklyn knows about the active community there. In fact, there are many parallels that have been drawn between the communities in Brooklyn and San Francisco. Brooklyn families are interested in progressive education, in diversity, and in experiential learning.  Brooklyn itself is an incredibly rich environment; full of the types of local experts, resources and cultural experiences that have enabled AltSchool success in the Bay Area.<br><br>

It should also be known that, when we asked our extended community where we should consider expanding outside of the Bay Area, Brooklyn raised their hand the highest. AltSchool is always looking for interested founding families to help us build new micro-schools and we will continue to strongly consider initial interest as we expand to more geographies.
<br><br>
What will AltSchool bring to Brooklyn?
<br><br>
The families we’ve spoken to in Brooklyn tell us they are ready for the kind of personalized, rigorous learning plans we are now known for in San Francisco.  We’ve already seen their interest in our whole child education, which incorporates aspects of social and emotional learning into every student activity and experience. They also tell us that demand far outweighs supply when it comes to quality K-8 schools in the area.
<br><br>
More broadly, AltSchool is excited to bring -- to Brooklyn and to all future locations -- the promise of the micro-school network experience. From a growing group of outstanding teachers that can tap each other for expertise, to centralized internal functions that do not need to be “dealt with” on an individual school level, there are so many benefits that a growing AltSchool network affords.  Beginning next fall, we can't wait to have Brooklyn part of that extended community of students, parents, and educators.<br><br>

I invite you to take a look at our admissions calendar and submit an application to join us Fall 2015.

	<b><a name="T7">Emergent Curriculum: Celebrating Dia de los Muertos</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Sophia Espinoza <br><br>

Nov 4, 2014 <br><br>


Dia de los Muertos (Day of the Dead) was celebrated a few days ago, October 31 - November 2. Leading up to it my co-teacher Jenelle and I designed learning experiences for our students around the event and its significance.
 <br><br>

As teachers who highly value multicultural education, we were excited to share this holiday with our students and show them a different perspective and tradition for remembering friends and family who have passed away. 
<br><br>
The occasion is also very relevant to our classroom’s setting here in San Francisco. Celebrations for Dia de los Muertos are palpable in the Mission District, with papel picado banners, skeleton figures, and marigolds displayed from the windows of homes and businesses in the neighborhood. Jenelle and I wanted to show our students that our immediate community is diverse and that people from all over the world make their home here. 
<br><br>
We created interdisciplinary lessons for our students at AltSchool’s Alamo Square location - reading aloud from books including I Remember Abuelito, learning about Mexican traditions like creating the ofrenda (altar), and practicing our Spanish via new vocabulary words (calavera, ofrenda, flores, pan de muertos, esqueleto). We made pan de muertos, papel picado, and paper flowers. We discussed the art of letter writing and students drafted a message to a person or pet who had passed away. Our students particularly enjoyed learning experiences outside of the classroom, like visiting the Dia de los Muertos exhibition at the Oakland Museum.
<br><br>
unnamed-2Our wonderful community of parents also got involved by volunteering in the classroom. Lucia helped the Lower Elementary students in creating a class altar, and made an incredible Day of the Dead slideshow. Cindy came in and made calaveras (sugar skulls) with us! Kate, a parent of one student at AltSchool’s Dogpatch classroom, brought supplies all the way from Mexico so the class could make molds for their calaveras during the extended day program with their teachers. During the regular school day, students frosted the designs and also made ofrendas.
<br><br>
Jenelle and I look forward to seeing more collaboration with parents happening in the future and learning more about our students’ interests so we can create emergent curriculum based on their passions and interests, as well as our own.

<br><br>
As an educator it's extremely gratifying to be empowered to share our interests and passions with students, and to create meaningful provocations from that collaboration.
<br><br>
We would love to know what events and occasions you wish you knew more about. And, what passions would you have wanted to explore at school when you were a child?

PotteryBarn2School should be a part of the community, and community should be a part of the school. In fact, the whole purpose for education has arisen completely out of a need from the greater community. In order for a community to survive and thrive, educating its future citizens is of utmost importance.

But somehow, education has turned into a segmented good, something mass manufactured and prepackaged, only to be delivered within the confines of the four walls of a school.  So how does one solve this problem?  How does one make it so this reality is no longer so?
<br><br>
You go out into the community.  That’s how. And this doesn’t sound as impossible as one would think.  In fact, it’s way easier.<br><br>
 
Yesterday, my class went to Pottery Barn.  Yup, you heard it right, the Pottery Barn.  Best and most free field trip ever.  Why you ask? To be inspired by the beautiful furniture and home decorations so that we may design our classroom.  Students bustled around with iPads and notebooks, taking pictures and sketching images of cabinets, chairs, and desks, bursting with ideas for classroom items.  We looked for shapes, uses for practical objects like lamps and pottery, and of course, beauty, so that our classroom may be a structured, practical, and beautiful place. Check out some of their sketches below.<br><br>

 

Teachers fantasize over making learning truly real world, but they tend to leave out the most important component of the real world, and that is, well, the real world.  In fact, the word “real world” has become so much of a buzzword that it’s become all too easy to forget what the term actually means.  But when it comes down to actually honoring the idea of “real world experiences,” we cannot expect to fulfill this manifest within the four walls of the classroom.
<br><br>
The ability to learn resides within a student’s ability to see himself or herself within the curriculum.  Moreover, the manifest of becoming a lifelong learner can only truly be achieved if a child can see himself or herself in the greater world.  By going out into the community, and by giving students truly “real-world” experiences, we can help to empower kids to be resourceful and use the community as a place of constant growth and learning.
<br><br>
And to think… it’s as simple as going to Pottery Barn.

AsianMuseum1Our upper elementary students are on a quest to know and understand the rich cultures of San Francisco.
 <br><br>
This past week, their explorations took them to the Asian Art Museum. Their guide introduced them to South Asian art and recounted Hindu history and folktales.<br><br>

Students were fascinated by the stories they heard. They asked questions like, "How were these works of art created?" and "How can Vishnu be both a creator and destroyer?" Students were also curious to learn about contemporary Hindu communities in the city.

So the class jumped on the MUNI to hit the farmer’s market at the San Francisco Ferry Building. There they scavenged for some lesser-known staples from that historic first Thanksgiving meal: eel, lobster, and cod, along with corn, radishes, mushrooms, lettuce, plums, and grapes.

	<b><a name="T11">Get the Benefits of Homeschooling in a Micro-School Environment</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Jul 30, 2014 <br><br>


W32-1Homeschooling is on the rise in the U.S. A recent CBS news story, "DIY Home Schooling Growing in Silicon Valley,” states that there are now two million children learning outside a traditional school in the United States.
<br><br>
Why the rise in homeschooling? 
<br><br>
More families today recognize that their children need a higher level of personalized attention than that offered in a traditional school environment. Whether a child is falling behind, not being challenged enough, or simply needs a flexible learning environment, research shows that structured homeschooling is an effective way to empower children in their education.<br><br>

But homeschooling can be a challenge. Creating a curriculum, finding the right resources, and evaluating your child’s progress are not always easy. There may also be limited social opportunities with other children and adult mentors. When you factor in these considerations, plus the additional time, energy, and resources that parents contribute to become full-time teachers, homeschooling can be huge commitment. 
<br><br>
That’s why we are proponents of the micro-school approach.
 <br><br>
In our micro-schools, we combine the advantages of a homeschooling environment with an intimate classroom experience. With a low student-to-teacher ratio, our teachers pay close attention to each student. Educators are constantly dialed in to each child’s short-, mid-, and long-term learning goals and create rich experiences for intellectual growth. 
<br><br>
At the same time, we know how important group learning is to a child’s development. Each classroom is composed of students who complement one another and learn from each other. Our students engage in frequent hands-on, collaborative projects so they build the social and emotional skills they need to succeed in today’s workplace environments. 
<br><br>
In the process of building our micro-school network, we are also learning how to create an outstanding learning environment for all kinds of children. This fall, we will have nine micro-school classrooms - each equipped with at least two full-time teachers, 16-24 students, and several community experts skilled in foreign language, fitness, and the arts. Each classroom is supported by a world-class team of designers, engineers, and operations professionals who are continuously developing and refining tools and processes to make learning as enriching as possible. 
<br><br>
When you consider the benefits of the micro-school network, coupled with the close-knit community of each classroom, you can see how our vision for a next-generation homeschooling environment takes shape.

	<b><a name="T12">A New Family Transfers to AltSchool </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Apr 23, 2014 <br><br>

Tahoe_fam_2013Families transfer their children to a new school for many reasons. We know that they need flexibility when such circumstances arise. That’s why we do our best to accommodate students into our micro-school network throughout the year.<br><br>

Our newest transfer student is a vivacious K-1 student, Ruby. Her mother, Renee, sent us an email last week to let us know how things have changed for Ruby since joining AltSchool.<br><br>
Renee writes: <br><br>

“I cannot overstate how thrilled we are -- all three of us. Ruby has come home every day this week bursting with excitement: ‘Mommy, today we read a book about Helen Keller, and did you know that she couldn't talk OR see OR hear but then her teacher, Annie, taught her to read?' 'Mommy, I LOVE the Mission Science Center - and can I get a pet snake?’ ‘Mommy, today I made a video with other kids about The Three Bears and then we got to watch it on THE BIG SCREEN!' ‘Mommy, today we read a book called Many Moons and then we drew pictures of what we thought the characters look like.
<br><br>

We went out for pizza tonight after I picked her up, and I asked Ruby to show me how she feels about her new school. This photo is what I got. Pretty much says it all." 
<br><br>
We followed up with Renee to ask her a few questions about her transfer experience. She graciously allowed us to share her responses with our community.<br><br>

Why did you decide to transfer Ruby to another school? What were some of your reservations about transferring?
<br><br>
“By the time we found AltSchool, we were deep in the process of looking for a new school. We started looking with the intent to transfer in the fall of 2014, Ruby's second grade year. But as the year went on, it became more and more urgent that we transfer, and while we were still prepared to finish first grade where she was, we also knew that if we found the right school and were able to transfer immediately, we would. 
<br><br>
Despite the urgency, we were not going to enroll Ruby in a school that was just good enough, no matter what. That's how we had ended up at her first elementary school, and we weren't doing that again. If we hadn't found AltSchool, chances are very good that I would have homeschooled Ruby next year. That was the contingency plan. All this is to say, we had no reservations about transferring, as long as our rather specific criteria were met.
<br><br>
The reasons for our dissatisfaction with Ruby's last school are many. Most importantly, she had started to dread going to school. And this is a gregarious, outgoing child who taught herself to read when she was 4, so irrepressibly eager was she to read books on her own. Her transition from preschool to kindergarten had been smooth; she really enjoyed kindergarten. Once she entered first grade, though, something shifted dramatically. 
<br><br>
Her school seemed to believe that only kindergarteners need a positive environment, choices, and creativity. First grade lessons focused on rote drills and memorization. There were spelling tests, math tests, timed math tests, social studies tests -- so many tests.There was no attention to social emotional development, no appreciation of individual learning style, and no flexibility. <br><br>

Ruby's dad and I watched her spirit get crushed before our eyes. Our kid, who had written songs for fun over summer vacation, a notebook full of them, told me one day that she hated writing. And it should be noted that she had lots of friends at school and received exceptional grades and reports - it wasn't that she wasn't succeeding from the school's perspective. It was startlingly clear to us, though, Ruby included, that little about her first grade year was a success. In September, when we first asked Ruby about finding a new school, she asked that we wait until her closest friend there went to another school, which will be happening when they are in third grade. By the beginning of October, she started asking questions like, ‘If I go to another school, can I still have playdates with Adelaide?’ And by the end of October, she told us, unprompted, that she wanted to go to a different school next year. Fortunately we had already started applications.<br><br>

I believe Ruby's last school was extreme in its failings. So, we were optimistic when we applied to new schools; so many of them promised to be ‘progressive’ and offer ‘individualized curricula.’ And then, one by one, admissions visit after admissions visit, we crossed each off the list -- each one, for different reasons, underwhelmed us. All but one of them would have been a considerable improvement, but none was good enough. I started Googling the process for homeschool.
<br><br>
One day when we were down to one school on our list of possibilities, I saw an AltSchool sticker on the back of a car in our neighborhood. I filled out the application that night but told my husband that it was just for the heck of it. I was curious; I was not optimistic.”<br><br>

What attracted you to AltSchool?<br><br>

“Before we had our first meeting, when our only information was what is available online, the main hooks were the student-teacher ratio, the promises of individualization, flexibility, and a range of learning experiences -- oh, and fun. Fun was as important as academic rigor. We were determined to find both -- or rather, we were determined to find all of them. These were the biggest hooks, but, again, I honestly did not believe we'd find them. We had been misled by so many schools at that point. In fact, when the matter of individualization came up, I asked flat out, ‘Show me how you do it.’ I expected that no one would be able to do so. But they were, and they did. As for flexibility, rigor, and a wide range of experiences, the only succinct way I can explain it is to say that I am 100% certain that Ruby is having the best and richest educational experience available to her, and I wholly expect it will only get better.”RubyAfterschool
<br><br>
What was the actual transfer experience like for your family in terms of applying, interviewing, and being placed in our classroom?<br><br>

“Our first meeting at AltSchool was with Sumeet -- just Justin and I, not Ruby. It was at that meeting that we knew -- already -- that we had found something very, very different. That meeting took all of my frustrated pessimism and blew it up. I had found the admission process up to that point to be almost infuriating. There we were, offering to pay $25,000 to hand over our kid to strangers for eight hours a day, and the prevailing attitude was that we needed to sell Ruby to them. I know this is a thing; I know that private schools are competitive, especially in San Francisco. However, that does not justify the timbre of these meetings, in which the administrators appeared to have little to no interest in our child or in our family. The conversations were unnecessarily tense and formal; our questions elicited canned, political answers; and, most importantly, the interactions seemed to mirror the dry, competitive tone of Ruby's classroom experience. Our meeting with Sumeet was entirely different. She answered our questions thoroughly and honestly; she was (or seemed - and that's good enough!) interested in Ruby; and the meeting was fun and exciting -- and, consistent with my theory, this matches Ruby's classroom experience so far.<br><br>

Once we realized, on both sides, that transferring now was an option, everything moved smoothly, quickly, and with Ruby's and the other students' best interests in mind. Ruby's transition was seamless, and on the first day, she came home bursting with news. She has been that way every day since. Moreover, any time I try to pick her up at 3:00, she sends me away. She often stays at aftercare even when she doesn't have to -- that's how seen and inspired she feels in that space.”

	<b><a name="T13">Student Interviews: The First Step Towards A Personalized Education</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Feb 20, 2014<br><br>


Our student interviews are not about admissions screening in the traditional sense. Instead, they are an opportunity to lay the foundation for a personalized learning experience.<br><br>

From the first moment we meet your child, we want to know how he or she learns about the world. We have two goals in mind:
 <br><br>
1- To better understand your child’s strengths, styles, and interests.
<br><br>
2- To take what we learn about your child to design an ideal class mix.<br><br>

Here’s an inside look into the K/1 child interview experience from the perspective of one of our teachers, Lauren Hancock.
<br><br>
Understanding your child<br><br>

To create a setting that helps us know your child as a learner, we have a room with lots of books, educational toys, and art materials. We take our cue from the children themselves to see what they are drawn to, observe how they play, and ask them questions about their experience. <br><br>

One of the interview activities we have for younger children involves exploring different materials. Our teachers lay out game materials on a table - checkers, marbles, backgammon pieces, dice, and others. 
<br><br>
During the activity, we ask children questions such as, “What do you see?” “What do you think you can do with these materials?” and “What do you wonder about them?” Our goal in asking these questions is to make thinking visible. We look to see where their curiosity and strengths lie through the way they engage with these materials. 
<br><br>
Take the example of three children who used the materials in recent interviews:
<br><br>
The first child was fascinated by the materials themselves. He was particularly interested in figuring out how many pieces fit within larger containers and displayed a keen sense of spatial awareness. 
<br><br>
The boy hypothesized, “Will all these marbles fit within this circle? I think so because this space is a lot bigger.”
<br><br>

He then wanted to see if all the pieces would fit within each other.

<br><br>
The second child found joy in organizing a game with the pieces. She designed a new game called “Harocky.” The game has nine rules in total and begins by spinning a spinner.  

<br><br>

The child showed strong organizational strengths and a proclivity for structured interaction. When she left the room, she mentioned that the teacher could leave the set-up as is for the next child to play. 
<br><br>
The third child was all about experimentation with the materials. He delighted in discovering the many ways that the materials could be used together. In one instance, the child stacked marbles on top of the plastic rings. 
<br><br>
He said, “I learned something new. You can use these as a marble track. See? Push the marbles and they move.”
<br><br>
Experimenter
<br><br>
The child then wanted to experiment with another design of the materials. He wondered if the marbles would fit through a plastic ring. 
<br><br>
“The game is now to shake the ring and get the marbles out,” he declared. 

<br><br>

Through this activity, we get a glimpse for how children interact with the world. We have an indication of how each child processes information - which is distinct from how other teachers often approach learning. 
<br><br>
“Teachers may unknowingly teach to their own style, not necessarily to the different styles of children in their class,” says Lauren.
<br><br>
Lauren takes these insights and begins to map out the learner profile of your child. She draws from this information on day one in the classroom (and continues to learn more about each student everyday) to design a tailored educational experience that excites and inspires. 
<br><br>
Building a class
<br><br>
After the interview process, our teachers sit down with the admissions team to create a balanced class. We consider how each child will contribute to and learn from the larger group of children we assemble. We also strive to create an ideal social environment for each child that includes friends, intellectual peers, good influences, and children that will stretch them or broaden their horizons in some way.
<br><br>
In the case of the children above, Lauren looks to see how the children will complement one another through their differentiated strengths.   
<br><br>
“The child who plans and the child who likes to experiment, for example, will both stretch each other in the classroom. They have much to teach each other about structure and spontaneity,” she says. 
<br><br>
Because the group setting will complement your child’s personalized education, we take great care to create a dynamic classroom with rich interaction that will help your child develop in ways that would be difficult to master individually.
<br><br>
Creating a Foundation for Personalized Learning
<br><br>
What begins at the AltSchool student interview is not only important because of what we discover and analyze from it; it is the crucial first step that begins an educational journey we feel honored to embark on with each of our students. We look forward to having you aboard.

	<b><a name="T14">Summer Camp Highlights from Educators and Engineers </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Sandy Naing <br><br>

Aug 7, 2014 <br><br>


What’s it like to create an imaginative experience for children to think and play like designers? 
<br><br>
Our educators and engineers had a ton of fun guiding students in creating sensational pieces of (pretend) candy during the inaugural summer camp program, “Wonky Willard’s Candy Factory.” 
<br><br>
They created opportunities for students to explore tastes, smells, and textures. They helped students develop working prototypes with hands-on and digital tools, like CubeTeam and 3-D printing. They also aided students in video editing and production to create commercials of their creations. 
<br><br>

In addition, the camp was a great way for new educators to work alongside existing teachers and AltSchool engineers.  
 <br><br>
Here’s what Kristin Uhlemeyer, a K-1 teacher, had to say about the experience: 
<br><br>
“One of the best ways to get to know your teaching team is to actually teach together!  Summer camp was perfect for team building.  I also loved that students, new and old, collaborated over the summer. I think that, for the kids, having the chance to experiment with new technology, try creative ideas, and iterate on designs has become synonymous with AltSchool.”<br><br>

Director of Engineering Slade Maurer, aka "Wonky Willard," shared this with us: 
<br><br>
“The summer camp gave me a chance to step out of my everyday role as an engineer to teach elementary school students about 3-D printing and computer-aided design. It was wonderful to influence so many young minds, get wrapped up in their energy, and watch them transform ideas into things.”
<br><br>
And, lastly, Jay Ho, mechanical engineer, said: 
<br><br>
"I was thrilled to teach kids about what I do as a designer and builder, but I also experienced first-hand how the products we work on are used by our teachers and students. I laughed to the point of collapsing with the kids as we filmed our commercial to advertise the "candy" they created."

Jul 9, 2014<br><br>


WW8After months of planning, it is finally here - AltSchool’s first week of summer camp! This week is dedicated to creating extraordinary experiences for K-1 students in design thinking and engineering. 
<br><br>
We checked in with Sarah Rothenberg, K-1 educator, to give us the scoop on what the kids have been up to so far. Their challenge is to prototype, design, build, and present their own mock-up of a virtual candy store using digital and hands-on tools. 
 <br><br>
On Monday, campers learned to think like designers. AltSchool teachers and Wonky Willard (aka Slade Maurer, AltSchool’s engineering director) probed students to consider the texture, size, shape, and sensory experience (sweet, salty, bitter) of their own candy designs.
<br><br>
Then, students practiced creating designs using CubeTeam.io and the 3D printer. Cubeteam.io is a painting and modeling program that students use to imagine and build their candy store before printing it out in 3D. The printer creates 3D “candy” from a one-dimensional candy design. 
<br><br>
“It’s really exciting to watch the students go through the design process of exploring their own tastes in candy. It’s so fun to see how diverse their tastes are. Children are coming up with candy designs I never would have imagined...like chocolate covered cotton candy. This is what designers do when they are given complete freedom to be inspired. That’s how the best inventions are made,” Sarah says. 
<br><br>
At the end of the week, students will present their project showcase to family and friends. Afterwards, students will have exclusive access to their shared virtual candy factory.
<br><br>
Next week (July 14-18), we will host upper elementary students in grades 2-5. The last week of our summer camp (July 21-25) is for middle school students.

	<b><a name="T17">The Science of Character</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Mar 20, 2014 <br><br>

 
Today marks the global premiere of the short film, “The Science of Character.” Filmmakers from the Moxie Institute explore the neuroscience and social science behind character development. Check it out:
<br><br>

We find this movie incredibly inspiring. Our teaching approach is based on the research of Carol Dweck and others that shows that character development is one of the most important things we can teach our children.  
<br><br>
This week, for example, we’ve been cultivating environmental responsibility in our classroom.
<br><br>
A student recently mentioned that her father asked the family to take shorter showers because of the drought. She wanted to know more about what he meant.
<br><br>
So we engaged in a class discussion about all the things that we use water for. We came up with a long list - from farming to cooking, electricity, and pretty much anything that is manufactured.
<br><br>
“ANYTHING that is manufactured? Even jeans?” asked a student in disbelief.
<br><br>
“Yes, even jeans,” Carolyn (our Director of Education) replied.
<br><br>
The next day, teachers brought in several items, including jeans, and asked students to guess how much water was required to produce each item. Students then compared their answers with those provided in a short water documentary.
<br><br>
Tomorrow, students will be calculating their water footprint. We will also be studying early irrigation systems in Mesopotamia and designing our own irrigation systems to learn how water flows to our city. With this knowledge, we’ll be devising ways to save water at home and in the community.  
<br><br>
“Taking on the perspective of others and developing core character strengths is the whole reason why we go to school. I can teach a child math or how to read at home. But we come together in a school community to learn from each other, listen to various perspectives, and inspire citizenship,” says Carolyn.
<br><br>
For us, #CharacterDay is everyday.

	<b><a name="T18">The Value in Making Makers: Why AltSchool Teaches Tinkering</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Sarah Rothenberg 
<br><br>
Apr 8, 2015 <br><br>


Have you ever wanted to try your hand at user-driven design? How about building, say, an airplane propellor, connecting “squishy” circuits, or playing video games with bananas? (Yes indeed, bananas.)
 <br><br>
photo_4-3AltSchool recently hosted our inaugural Family Maker Day, curated by Maria Tranquilli, our in-house Maker specialist. The day gave parents and students the chance to tinker, experiment, build, paint, sculpt, and more. Maker education encourages students to explore through building and creating, and it is core to AltSchool’s project-based learning approach.
<br><br>
And based on the success of our recent Maker Day, I thought to reflect on just why I integrate maker education in my lower elementary classroom.
<br><br>
1. There’s no failure when you’re making things: experimentation teaches “grit”
<br><br>
We encourage children to be OK with making mistakes. We can often gain the deepest insights and learnings through our mistakes. Most parents and children are surprised when I offer a pencil without an eraser to my 5 year olds. I do this because I celebrate mistakes as not just a learning experience, but as a vehicle for self-improvement― to make us stronger.
<br><br>
Through designing, testing, building, failing, and iterating, children can gain a healthy mindset about mistakes and reflect on how these mistakes actually facilitate continual improvement.
<br><br>
2. Maker projects allow students to find and express their own passions
<br><br>
When students are given the chance to engage in a project of their choice, we, as educators, can see if students gravitate towards, say, clay, circuitry, or building blocks. We can then use this creative energy to develop their natural interests through inspiring learning experiences. When students are passionate about what they are doing, their imaginations blossom and the learning becomes exciting.
<br><br>
Our goal is to equip students early with experiences to build an early foundation for continued self-growth and exploration.<br><br>
3. Making and tinkering inspires real-life problem-finding skills
<br><br>
Maker projects inspires both problem-finding and problem-solving skills. Using design-thinking principles, children are challenged to think about different types of users, identify problems, design solutions, and test their ideas in a tactile, engaging (and fun) way! These real-life connections hook the children into a project that is meaningful and relatable.<br><br>

4. Partner-based maker projects can inspire collaboration beyond the classroom
<br><br>
photo2Maker events like our Family Maker Day can provide great opportunities for community building and collaboration. In our Maker Event, our maker education guru Maria created partner-centered activities that had to be done by both child and adult. For example, many of the maker stations were slightly too difficult for children― either physically or scientifically advanced. The dynamic of such projects required parents to take a guiding role, thereby stretching student learning curves and bringing parents and children closer together. This allowed the parents to get their hands dirty alongside their child.
<br><br>
Maker projects also bring together the school community of educators. Each teacher has a unique skillset and individual interests. Maker events and projects provide opportunities for us to creatively encourage hands-on projects for students in line with our areas of expertise, interests, or lesson plans. Katie Gibbons, the head of the Fort Mason location that hosted the fair, has a beautiful way of fostering this type of unique creativity among teachers. Her encouragement of maker education continually provides ways to engage, inspire, motivate, and bring together the educators at our school.

	<b><a name="T19">What happens when students assess their schools for a change?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by The AltSchool Team <br><br>

Mar 24, 2015 <br><br>


IMG_1833How many schools can you name that collect regular feedback from students about their satisfaction and happiness? Most likely a few (or even none) come to mind. <br><br>
In building our student satisfaction program at AltSchool, we reached out to other schools to learn about their satisfaction practices and found it surprising that few ask for regular feedback from their students. Even fewer schools actually take action on that feedback. If a school’s goal is to help foster and develop its students to their fullest potentials, shouldn’t students have an active voice in this process?  <br><br>

Feedback is core to AltSchool’s growth plan. One of our tenets is to become better as we scale, and in order to improve rapidly we regularly solicit and make changes based on feedback from our stakeholders: parents, teachers, and students. The collaboration between these groups allows each to actively co-create and improve the learning experiences at AltSchool. And students are at the center of this. In addition to assessing progression, we want to understand and measure the degree to which students are happy, supported, and engaged. We want to ensure that their voices are heard and are driving the educational experiences they receive.  <br><br>

After completing the second student feedback cycle, we wanted to share some of the intangible and tangible results of our student satisfaction program. Here are five reasons why assessing student satisfaction is so important within school environments:<br><br>

1. We’re on a learning journey together
<br><br>
By proactively asking students to provide feedback about their experiences―from the curriculum and course materials, to their teachers and classmates, to field trips or overall happiness―AltSchool is gaining the information needed to improve and grow as an organization. We recognize that like our students, AltSchool is on its own learning journey and improving as we grow.<br><br>

2. Students learn to reflect <br><br>

The process of reflecting is healthy for children. At AltSchool, we discourage students from passively absorbing content, and we instead invite them to choose academic paths that interest them most. Through reflection, students develop ownership and agency in their learning, which is only augmented when they know that their school will work to improve, too.<br><br>
3. We can test our perceptions of student happiness<br><br>

In addition to surveying students, we asked teachers and parents to rate each child’s satisfaction. We could then see if parents and teachers have a truly accurate perception of each student’s satisfaction across multiple areas in their learning experience.<br><br>

After our first feedback cycle we found that there was not a statistical correlation between teacher and parent predictions of student happiness and the students’ own happiness ratings. These results further confirmed for us just how important it is that we ask students themselves about their own happiness at school! Though close, parents and teachers can only provide part of the story.
<br><br>
4. Feedback empowers teachers with additional insights <br><br>

Schools and teachers may be reticent to student feedback for fear of evaluation, but we’ve found that reviewing feedback together is an effective way for teachers to celebrate successes and identify opportunities. We’ve held group working sessions in which teachers were given their individual student and classroom level data, as well as their classroom data compared to the overall network. We asked them: do you see any patterns among students? Were there any surprises?  What are you proud of? What concerns you most?<br><br>
The responses were extremely positive! Through data, teachers were able to confirm their hunches and also uncover certain areas for improvement.<br><br>

5. We gain benchmarks for improvement<br><br>

In soliciting student satisfaction feedback we can assess other areas critical for student happiness and success. To assess whole-child well-being, we divided our surveys into three overarching categories: 
<br><br>
1.Classroom environment<br><br>


2.Feelings of success, and <br><br>


3.Qualities of a successful learner
<br><br>

The classroom environment focused on areas relating to AltSchool’s physical space and the degree to which in-class offerings meet student needs; feelings of success centered on topics such as the child’s sense of belonging, esteem, and relationships in the classroom (teacher or peer); and qualities of a successful learner focused on student engagement, grit, expectations, and rigor.<br><br>

Having only conducted one survey cycle in its current form, we now have benchmarks to continually gauge improvement. We can benchmark across all students and classrooms, as well as year over year. The survey also surfaced invaluable qualitative data from students through their comments.  When asked, students provide insights and solutions that may not have bubbled up in the classroom. For example, one teaching team incorporated more art into their class after many students shared a desire for more art.<br><br>

Last thoughts<br><br>

We’ve found that implementing a formal feedback program helps to create healthy culture of listening, collaboration, and reflection. We look forward to continually gaining insights and improvements through our learning journey with AltSchool students, parents, and teachers.

	<b><a name="T20">Scaling a Personalized Education Model: Reflections on the Past Twelve Months</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by The AltSchool Team <br><br>

Mar 4, 2015 <br><br>


Last March we announced $33 Million in funding from Founders Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, and other leading investors. Since then AltSchool has opened three additional schools, increased enrollment from 20 to 150 students and more than tripled company headcount C from 30 to 100+ employees. Over 2,200 candidates applied for 20 new teacher spots in 2014. This fall, AltSchool will open new schools from California to New York to accommodate 500 students in 2015.
 <br><br>
Square0558At AltSchool, scale is at the heart of our approach. In fact, AltSchool is built in such a way that the more we grow, the more we are able to improve experiences for everyone involved. The bigger we get, the more feedback we can collect from students, parents, and teachers; the more best-practices and knowledge we can share internally through our product and community; and the more we can empower teachers and parents to create personalized experiences for each student.
<br><br>
Today, as we begin a new chapter by welcoming domain experts to our executive team in Engineering, Safety, Product Management, and Finance, we’re sharing achievements from the past twelve months that will set us up for continued growth and innovation. <br><br>

Expanding from Single to Networked Schools
<br><br>
When we started AltSchool, our goal was to build a network of schools rather than a standalone school. That networked approach enables us to simultaneously maintain small, intimate class sizes while expanding to more students and families. In 2014, we successfully grew from a single school to four schools in San Francisco and will open in Palo Alto and Brooklyn later this year while we add expand to two additional neighborhoods in San Francisco.
<br><br>
The AltSchool platform is built for sharing knowledge across our teacher network; it enables our educators to actively create curriculum in ways that make it easy for other educators to access and build on the work of others throughout subsequent years. During 2014, our technology empowered educators to track and manage every facet of their students’ education; moving towards a future we often describe as “Montessori 2.0.”
<br><br>
The first step has been logging and tagging curriculum choices within the platform. Beginning this year, our system will start “pushing” information to educators to help them to proactively enhance students’ learning C from discovering the best techniques to teach difficult algebra problems to recommending phonics tools that are particularly useful for beginning readers. AltSchool educators will have a rich pool of resources to draw from to build personalized learning plans for individual students or to enhance the classroom experience by sourcing vetted best practices from other educators within the network.
<br><br>
Collecting and Actioning Real-time Student, Parent, and Teacher Feedback
<br><br>
AltSchool actively solicits and drives internal improvement by collecting regular feedback from three critical stakeholders: students, parents, and teachers. We have three internal teams who are respectively focused on increasing the satisfaction of each group. This way, students, parents, and teachers are co-creators in the educational experience and AltSchool can respond in real-time to their needs.
<br><br>In 2014, we asked students to evaluate and rank their education experience at AltSchool. Students shared their perspective on ten categories that included everything from interest in subjects to their classroom environment. Based on student preferences, we are “unbundling” extracurricular activities, restructuring the balance of indoor versus outdoor play spaces and finding new ways to incorporate video into the academic experience.
<br><br>
For parents, our focus began with a goal of continuous and efficient communication, a system in which information flows in both directions. But our commitment to parent satisfaction extends beyond that; we also rely on parents to help us shape our schools and inform our products. Over the past year, we introduced quarterly Parent Satisfaction Surveys. Through our survey program, we learned that parents prefer to be notified about their child’s learning achievements differently, depending on the type of information being shared. For example, parents might like to see a video of their five year-old reading her first sentence immediately, while an update on a long-term project may be better communicated in a weekly Learning Update. <br><br>

Moving forward, we’re developing a newsfeed-like resource to support real-time updates on student progress, as well as a Learning Progression datasheet (a cumulative overview that summarizes key information to track students’ progress against standards). We also learned that parents want more opportunities to connect with other AltSchool families. We recently hired a Head of Community to work with parents to accelerate and nurture classroom, site, and network-wide relationships.
<br><br>
We’ve also implemented a series of programs to support and help empower our teachers. For example, each month teachers take a 130-point Teacher Satisfaction Survey to proactively evaluate how we can improve their experience. That includes everything from offering professional development opportunities to how well substitute teachers perform to lunch options. Our School Experience Committee meets with teachers on a weekly basis to shape policies in a way that will ensure their success. Plus, we’ve leveraged a customer support portal to manage day-to-day workflow as issues arise. In the past year alone we’ve processed hundreds of requests from educators, solving actual teacher problems in real-time so that they can focus on students.  <br><br>

Offline Learning Augmented by Increased Digital Tracking and Monitoring
<br><br>
Square1162The majority of student learning at AltSchool happens away from a screen. Technology, however, enables us to document and track progress in each student’s Learner Portrait, a sort of supercharged transcript. Technology allows us to capture all aspects of a student’s work, including a teacher’s assessment and the student’s own reflection on each assignment.<br><br>

Next year, the amount of real-world work captured digitally in a Learner Portrait will more than double. This documentation supercharges teachers' abilities to communicate the richness of the school day home to parents and create digital student portfolios. Such tools also help to consolidate information for teachers to review more efficiently and to showcase examples of completed student work for future reference.
<br><br>
We also successfully prototyped several tools to impact personalization, with many more to be integrated into our platform next year. For example, the Teacher Observation Tool is an iPad / iPhone software product that gives educators an easy way to capture scans of learning artifacts in the classroom and away from school so that the information is directly absorbed into the AltSchool Learning Cycle suite of products. As we find more ways to learn from the community outside of the classroom, we are leveraging technology that enables us to integrate these experiences into our digital learning platform.
<br><br>
These changes reflect our ideology in action, always using first principles as our guide to completely reimagine education from the ground up. We look forward to sharing more behind-the-scenes updates about how we’re working to make AltSchool’s vision of a modern, 21st century education a reality for all children.

	<b><a name="T21">How We Build Better Teachers: AltSchool Professional Development</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Aug 15, 2014 <br><br> 


What happens when you bring together twenty-four of the country’s most exceptional educators to share with each other? <br><br>

A beautiful teaching community emerges. <br><br>

In the spirit of building a better teacher, we gave our teachers the opportunity to design their own professional development experience. <br><br>

Over the past five weeks, new teachers explored, played, laughed, and learned together as they prepared for the exciting start of the school year. <br><br>

Here are highlights from the journey.<br><br>
 
 Personalization is Not Just For Kids<br><br>

“Just as we personalize the educational experience for students, we personalize the experience for teachers,” says Dan Barber, Head of Teacher Satisfaction. <br><br>

Dan and his team worked hard to make sure teachers got the most out of their time together. They reached out to teachers beforehand to ask for their input on what kinds of skills and content they were interested in learning. They made sure the experience built on teacher strengths and helped them address any weaknesses. 
<br><br>
“Each educator has the option to choose what they want and need to learn. This is authentic and reflective of the education we give our kids,” says Dan.<br><br>

Start With Why<br><br>
The first few days teachers spent together were all about answering the question, “Why are we here?” Because our teachers come from a variety of educational backgrounds and school experiences, we wanted to give them a forum to share why they chose to come teach at AltSchool.  <br><br>

“One of the things we keep hearing from teachers is how incredible it is to meet and work with other educators from such diverse teaching backgrounds,” says Alison Lee, Head of Educator Recruiting. 
<br><br>
In a design session, teachers explored each others’ perspectives on classroom values and culture. Teachers mentioned the need for “a culture of play,” “open exploration,” and “real-world experiences.” 
<br><br>
You can see some of their other ideas on post-its below.<br><br>
We also spent time explaining the origin of AltSchool, the research behind the new teaching tools we created, and how engineers and designers work with teachers to address real-world needs in the classroom.
<br><br>
We shared all the ways AltSchool supports teachers in their craft, including giving teachers ample time for collaboration and empowering teachers with meaningful data on student progress. We also discussed the AltSchool Learning Objectives, the global set of standards that form the foundation for how each student grows and develops over time. 
<br><br>
Learn from Each Other<br><br>

What teachers appreciated most during our time together was learning from each other. We asked them to lead their own workshops and share best practices from their fields of expertise.
<br><br>
“It felt great to see the wheels turning in my colleagues’ heads as they began to think of how they could use the techniques and ideas we presented. I feel so lucky to be amongst such a vibrant, knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff...it really is like a dream come true,” says Emma Simmons, who co-led a workshop on social and emotional learning with Jaqi Garcia.  <br><br>

Some of the other teacher-led workshops included:
<br><br>
--Making and Tinkering: How to design hands-on learning activities with electronics, 3-D printing, and laser cutting.
<br><br>

--Universal Design for Learning: How to use UDL guidelines to design curriculum that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn.  
<br><br>

--Best Practices in Teaching Elementary Math: How to teach rigorous mathematics using an emergent curriculum. 

<br><br>
--Interdisciplinary Instruction: How to teach “anything within anything” in a rigorous setting.
<br><br>
--Best Practices in Team Teaching: How to build upon prior teaching experiences to enhance educator collaboration.

<br><br>
As the school year approaches, we will continue to give teachers ample opportunities to continue sharing and learning from each other, as well as keep our community abreast of the ways teachers continuously improve the art and science of educating.<br><br>

"I’ve never been part of an organization that trusts teachers so much and holds them to such a high level.  It makes me want to work harder, learn more, and push my thinking to even broader levels,” says Paul France, a new teacher at AltSchool Fort Mason, on his personal blog.
<br><br>
Given that our teachers are already of the highest caliber, we are humbled to hear such feedback. This is why we’re here - to help teachers and students be their absolute best.

	<b><a name="T22">Educators as 21st Century Knowledge Workers</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Posted by Dan Barber <br><br>

Aug 12, 2014 <br><br>


Educating children to actualize their full potential is one of the highest professional callings in our society. We do all we can to honor and empower teachers, especially those who work to continuously improve their craft.  
<br><br>
As I heard from new teacher, Emma Simmons, "It’s refreshing to be treated like a professional." 
<br><br>
We know that teachers work incredibly hard to help children succeed, despite not always having the tools or working environment that other professionals take for granted.
<br><br>
I recently came across an article by Linda Darling-Hammond that brings to light just how challenging being a teacher can be these days. She discusses the results of the Teaching and Learning International Survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which states that “American teachers today work harder under much more challenging conditions than teachers elsewhere in the industrialized world.”
<br><br>
The research finds that teachers:<br><br>
--receive less useful feedback than educators in other countries,<br><br>
--get less helpful professional development, and<br><br>
--have less time to collaborate to improve their work.<br><br>

At AltSchool, we create a 21st century working environment where teachers are valued and supported in their craft. Just like we respect our students as individuals, we respect our teachers.<br><br>

Here are some of the ways we do that. 
<br><br>
Create A Collaborative Environment: In our micro-schools, co-teaching is the norm. On average, our educator teams consist of four individuals -- often at different stages in their careers -- with two teachers in each classroom together throughout the day. The curriculum, assessment strategies, and best practices they develop in their classrooms are instantly shared across AltSchool’s network, allowing teachers in other micro-schools to learn from each other. Through new collaborative teaching tools, we give exemplary educators the leverage to impact massive numbers of students at scale. Additionally, less experienced teachers get constant support in the classroom and grow over time through the positive examples of peers and mentors.<br><br>

TeacherPDDanPostProvide High-Quality Feedback: Transparency and effective communication are keys to successful teaching at AltSchool. Our teachers regularly give and receive reflection and feedback to and from each other. They are not only accountable to their teams, but also to the students, families and communities they serve. <br><br>

Empower Teachers with Meaningful Data: Our teachers are modern knowledge workers who work with data to continuously iterate and improve the educational experience. They use technology to streamline almost every data-driven process, from taking attendance to reviewing student progress, and course-correct on a daily basis. They also work in tandem with engineers to create new tools for addressing needs in the classroom.  <br><br>

Value Teaching and Teacher Learning: We believe that teaching should be a fantastically enriching, impactful, and satisfying job that is compensated in a way that reflects the level of expertise and skills educators possess. Besides reimagining the fundamental aspects of a teacher’s job, we are changing what compensation and growth look like. We provide a clear and continuous career path with a commitment to upward mobility that gives teachers the opportunity to earn six figures. They also have flexibility regarding when they can take off and receive equity -- much like many of the perks non-teachers enjoy at modern companies such as Google and Facebook. <br><br>

Moreover, we support ambitious educators to continue their time in the classroom. Experienced AltSchool teachers are encouraged to become lead educators at new micro-schools and build innovative curricular resources for hundreds of students within the network.<br><br>

As we enter into our second year and expand our teaching team from 5 to 24 educators, we will continue to document and evaluate the experiences of our educators in this model. <br><br>

So far, we have heard lots of positive sentiment from our teachers. In a recent survey we conducted with teachers, 100% “strongly agree that they have learned new skills while at AltSchool."<br><br>

One teacher remarked, “I absolutely love working at AltSchool and feel like it has truly changed my life.”<br><br>

It is through a deliberate revamp that we hope to bring both more great professionals into the teaching world, and to maximize teacher effectiveness and satisfaction across our micro-school network. We respect our educators as professionals, just as our teachers respect children as learners. <br><br>

IMG_1070(2)We warmly welcome Paul France to the AltSchool community. Paul will be teaching at the upper elementary level starting in the fall of 2014.<br><br>

Meet Paul
<br><br>
Paul's teaching approach is grounded in the relationships he builds with his students. He believes that a classroom culture grounded in mutual trust allows students to take risks, make mistakes, and ultimately become self-directed and flexible thinkers. Paul taught fourth and fifth grade on the North Shore of Chicago for four years after graduating from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2010. During that time, Paul also earned his master's degree in language and literacy from Roosevelt University in Chicago. <br><br>

Paul helped lead a 1:1 iPad initiative on the North Shore of Chicago, welcoming upwards of 100 professionals into his classroom throughout the course of the two year pilot. He is adept at crafting and delivering professional development on the Flipped Classroom, using classroom websites in instruction, and integrating technology into interdisciplinary units of instruction. You can learn more about Paul as a teacher and learner through his website.
 <br><br>
A Chat with Paul<br><br>

Tell us about one of your most memorable teaching experiences.
<br><br>
“One of my most memorable teaching experiences was learning about values with my students this year.  The original intent of the unit was to help students understand the multiple perspectives at play in the American Revolution by analyzing the values of key historical figures, while also developing an understanding of how values affect the decisions that all people make each and every day.<br><br>

"As a part of our unit, we watched Sarah Kay's TED talk, ‘If I should have a daughter...’ where she discusses the importance of writing ‘who you are’ into each of your writing pieces. This portion of our unit was an incredible segue way into learning what vulnerability truly means for writers. Students were able to artfully and creatively communicate their values, each in their own unique way.  We finished this experience with a Poetry Slam, where students, parents, and teachers gathered to listen to each student's poem, and of course, drink some warm hot chocolate in the midst of our cold Chicago winter. I loved this experience because I was able to see just how powerful our words can be, and that when we share parts of ourselves, our community can grow stronger.”<br><br>

How would a student or a parent describe you?<br><br>

"My students and their parents would describe me as funny, odd, unique, and enthusiastic.  All of them know my mantra, inspired by my high school drama teacher, Mr. Morton: 'Nothing great was ever achieved without enthusiasm.' They know that I love to learn, and that is most likely one of the first things they would say about me.<br><br>

“Recently, I received a letter from a parent who said, ‘You have gone above and beyond to teach students about the character of a person and how that is most important in life. Your emphasis on 'staying true to yourself' is a life lesson that I hope the kids carry with them through their journey.’  <br><br>

"Also, when creating our ‘classroom timeline’ at the end of this past year, one of my students posted this Post-it note on our bulletin board:<br><br>

 
What key traits do you hope to instill in your students?<br><br>

“I hope that all of my students leave our classroom feeling empowered and inspired to continue learning in their own way. I truly believe that learning is one of life's greatest gifts because every lesson we learn gives us a chance to get to know ourselves better.  Learning allows us to collaborate with individuals and find our own identities within the broader context of a community. If my students leave the classroom loving to learn, I know I've done my job.”
