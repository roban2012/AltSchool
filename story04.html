It’s a whole new world out there. <br><br>

The sheer amount of information available today calls for us to go far beyond the conventional “one size fits all” approach to education. At AltSchool, we’ve reimagined the entire educational experience from the ground up. We’re preparing our children for the future by offering them: <br><br>

	<hr><br>

Children are naturally curious and capable learners. Our Personalized Learning Plans help them drive their own education through their real-world motivations and interests. AltSchool teachers curate our rigorous curriculum in partnership with students and parents, allowing children to learn at their own pace and in the ways they learn best. Read about  how we personalize education from our founder, Max Ventilla.

The world itself is captivating and interconnected. At AltSchool, we encourage interdisciplinary learning and avoid artificial separation between subjects. Encouraging students to learn by doing, we promote a deeper level of understanding. Teaching may originate in the classroom, but will continue on trips throughout the community, at home, or even on family vacations (which are welcomed throughout the year).

	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool is building a network of micro-schools because we understand that children thrive under the nurturing warmth of a community. Our “village” is made up of inspiring teachers who co-learn with their students, asking questions, discovering connections and exploring relationships (with a low student-teacher ratio in the classroom). Our schoolhouses are supported by deep parent involvement, and active use of the best people and places that local areas have to offer.

We agree with the research: social and emotional learning (SEL) is critical to student success in school and in life. AltSchool balances academic rigor with an emphasis on growing good citizens. We help our students to become self-aware and to develop the skills for good decision-making. Throughout, we encourage the grit, resilience, confidence and social engagement necessary for happiness and success in the 21st century. 
<br><br>

While our students’ capacity for growth is huge, our time with them is precious. We set high expectations for that time, providing teachers with the tools, flexibility and support they need to best focus on their students. We benchmark ourselves to high standards and global best practices to drive continuous improvement.

T-Shaped Students for Life <br><br>

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Feb 12, 2014  <br><br>


 Many people ask us, “What is the goal of an AltSchool education？”  
<br><br>
To help children succeed in the world of 2030, we have many goals. 
<br><br>
Among them are:<br><br>
--to instill a positive mindset,
<br><br>
--to cultivate grit for meeting life’s challenges, and 
<br><br>

--to inspire lifelong curiosity.  
<br><br>
 
But there is one goal that really stands out for us.
<br><br>
Our goal for AltSchool students is to help them grow up T-shaped.
<br><br>
To thrive in this world, students need both breadth and depth in their educational experience.
<br><br>
T-shaped students are highly skilled and deeply talented in a single field, but also embody a horizontal breadth of interest, knowledge, and enthusiasm that cuts across disciplines. 
<br><br>
The Power of the T 
<br><br>
When we look at a traditional primary education, we see that schools focus mainly on the horizontal part of the T. Most primary education programs expose students to several different content areas without empowering students to go especially deep in any of them. 
<br><br>
In college and the workplace, there is usually the opposite problem - too much emphasis on the “I.” Individuals are siloed into separate majors. Professionals become experts in one domain and find it difficult to do cross-collaboration and interdisciplinary work. 
<br><br>
As a solution to this problem, thought leaders in education and design thinking, John Hennessy (Stanford University President) and Tim Brown (CEO of IDEO), respectively, promote the idea of T-shaped individuals. 
<br><br>
For Hennessy, T-shaped individuals emerge within an interdisciplinary culture. At Stanford, Hennessy spearheads university initiatives for students with diverse interests to work together on solutions to real-world problems. 
<br><br>
For Brown, T-shaped individuals are those who have a strong sense of empathy and enthusiasm. At IDEO, Brown encourages team members to understand a given problem from another’s perspective and work collaboratively to solve that problem. 
<br><br>
For us, we instill a T-shaped dimension in our students in three ways:
<br><br>
1- We create an environment for students to cultivate their personal passions.
<br><br>
2- We help students use those passions as a lever for building competencies in other subject areas. 
<br><br>
3- We match students with outside experts and with students who have complementary skills sets to work collaboratively on projects of impact. 
<br><br>
For example, in our current classroom, we have a few upper elementary students who are passionate about Minecraft. Through their weekly playlist activities, the students use Minecraft as a window to build math, engineering, and even social science skills. As a team, the students are building a scaled digital version of San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake. As students progress in their studies through middle school, they may even begin to work with local engineers on actual design projects that have tangible benefits for the classroom and surrounding community. 
<br><br>
What does a T-shaped AltSchool student look like？ 
<br><br>

When our students graduate from a K-8 education, they will have acquired deep mastery in one or more areas of passion. Throughout the course of their education, and particularly in middle school, students have ample opportunities to explore their interests and cultivate uniquely differentiated strengths. With mentorship from teachers and experts in the community, AltSchool students develop competence that far exceeds the baseline set by typical standards in their area of interest and would be recognized as significant by adult practitioners in the field. 
<br><br>
In addition, each student graduates with a broad base of knowledge and experiences representing a strong grasp of essential academic and non-academic skills. They will have met the expectations of widely accepted standards, such as Common Core and Next Generation Science Standards. They will have had myriad experiences working collaboratively and iteratively on real-world projects that foster nimble thinking across subject areas. 
<br><br>
Through these experiences, children are wholly capable of developing a T-shaped disposition. This disposition not only prepares them to succeed in leading universities and workplaces, but also helps them flourish as problem-seekers and problem-solvers in the world of tomorrow.

	<hr><br>
	
The Learner Portrait: When a child joins AltSchool, we create a Learner Portrait that is continually updated throughout his or her time with us. It catalogs interests, passions, strengths, weaknesses, and learning strategies that work best. It also reflects the AltSchool Learner Objectives that have been met to date by each student. 
<br><br>
Personalized Learning Plan (PLP): Based on the Learner Portrait, our educators (in collaboration with family and students) prioritize a set of goals from the AltSchool Learner Objectives. The PLP is reviewed regularly and informs the Playlist activities a student sees each week. 
<br><br>
The Playlist: The Playlist is a set of weekly learning experiences and exercises that help students meet their specific PLP goals. The Playlist includes individual and group activities, as well as short-term and long-term projects. Once a PLP goal is successfully completed, this achievement is recorded as a milestone on a student’s Learner Profile. 
<br><br>

	<b><a name="T9">AltSchool Learner Objectives </a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool’s curriculum includes objectives in four major areas. 
<br><br>
 Ways of Thinking: This area includes cognitive procedures, reasoning, and creativity.
<br><br>
Ways of Being: This area includes self-awareness, self-confidence, growth mindset, gratitude, curiosity, self-regulation, and grit.
<br><br>
Ways of Interacting: This area includes empathy, perspective taking, communication, collaboration, and building relationships.
<br><br>
Knowledge and Experiences: This area includes language arts, history, culture, media, citizenship, mathematics, science and the environment, entrepreneurship, and health. We also want each child to have the experience of going deep in an area of interest.
<br><br>
These learning objectives draw from a variety of standards and metrics as a framework for instructional design. Our elementary and middle school instruction is informed by the Common Core, National Council of the Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), Next Generation Science Standards, International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), Partnership for 21st Century Skills, and the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), among others.

AltSchool teachers curate learning activities for each child based on many outstanding curricular resources available, as well as resources they design themselves. In math, for example, we use programs such as Everyday Mathematics, Singapore Math, and First in Math. In language arts, we use Reading and Writing Project, 6+1 Traits, Handwriting Without Tears, Sitton Spelling, and Word Skills.

Each Playlist activity is assessed by a teacher and reflected upon by the student. Assessments may be rubric-based, narrative-based, or involve a quiz or problem. Based on these weekly assessments, each student’s Playlist is updated for the following week to reflect achievements in PLP goals. Parents receive regular progress reports on Playlist activities. 
<br><br>
In addition, we use Measures of Academic Progress (MAP), a nationally-normed standardized test, three times each year to assess student progress in math, reading, and language arts. MAP is an adaptive computer-based test that adjusts to a child’s level and takes less time away from instruction than a traditional standardized test. We use MAP results to tailor instruction and track progress against grade-level benchmarks.

Our micro-school approach is based on the principle that students learn most effectively when their education is applicable to the real-world. Our goal is to enable students to make meaningful connections and foster curiosity and wonder about the world we live in. We visit local businesses, neighborhood centers, community gardens, science institutions, and maker shops (to name a few). We also bring new energy and knowledge into AltSchool through community experts. Artists, professors, musicians, and innovators from diverse fields visit our classroom to offer learning experiences that broaden and enrich the AltSchool education.

What are the best places in the city to inspire, inform, and excite children?
<br><br>
This past school year, our students ventured all over the Bay Area to learn about science, history, ecology, and the arts. 
<br><br>
Based on their experiences, here are recommendations from our teachers on the best places to take kids for play and purpose. 
<br><br>
Top Places to Take Children in San Francisco
 <br><br>
Asian Art Museum: The Asian Art Museum is full of treasures that fascinate children. Make sure to take advantage of the storytelling tours. “Our fantastic, spirited docent told stories of Hindu deities while pointing out their depictions in art. The kids loved it and they learned a ton!” says Sophia, one of our upper elementary teachers. See pictures from their experience. 
<br><br>
Mission Science Workshop: “This is an amazing facility with a million hands-on things to check out!” says Sophia. Our students visited MSW twice this year. Check out their after school and Summer Scientist programs. 
<br><br>
Flora Grubb: You may not immediately think of a gardening shop as a place to explore with your child, but Flora Grubb (owner) has an incredibly imaginative space. We took our younger students here to find plants for our flower box project. Check out the fun we had exploring Flora Grubb.
<br><br>
Explore14Angel Island: Angel Island is a state park where families can enjoy hiking and playing on the beach. “The ferry ride to the island is beautiful and the kids love exploring the boat,” says Carolyn, our Director of Education. Older children (age 7 and above) will also enjoy the historical exhibit that provides a real-world perspective of what it was like to be a Chinese immigrant to the U.S. at the turn of the century. See pictures of our Angel Island adventure. 
<br><br>
Chinatown Alleyway Tour: This tour is a phenomenal way to get up close and personal with one of San Francisco’s most colorful neighborhoods. The tour guides are young people who are experts on Chinatown history. The tour also includes a stop at the fortune cookie factory, where you can have your own fortune added to a cookie for one dollar.
<br><br>
Fort Point: Our upper elementary students visited Fort Point during our first week of school. “The children loved exploring the Civil War era fort. Be sure to climb to the top and sit directly under the Golden Gate Bridge,” says Carolyn. Note, the National Park is only open Friday through Sunday.
<br><br>
YBCenter4Japanese Tea Gardens: Nestled in between the De Young and California Academy, the Japanese Tea Gardens are a hidden gem of Golden Gate Park. They are one of the most beautifully landscaped gardens around and offer a quiet respite where even the most active children can find some tranquility. Bring your sketch books and have fun observing and drawing flowers.
<br><br>



Exploratorium: The Exploratorium is perfect for inspiring curiosity and wonder. Every exhibit is hands-on and makes physics and biology come alive for kids. Located on the pier, the Exploratorium also offers breathtaking views of the Bay and is an ideal spot for an outdoor lunch.
<br><br>
Presidio/Crissy Fields and Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy: Engaging and passionate educators coupled with incredible programming makes the Golden Gate National Parks Conservancy an amazing place to learn about the Bay's natural environment. Connecting with nature in an urban environment can be difficult, but with the Conservancy, families can volunteer together to care for our parks. They can also take interpretive walks along the many hiking trails to learn more about native plants and animals. Picnic on the beach afterward to have an unplugged day of fun.  

<br><br>


Children's Creativity Museum: The museum offers a perfect combination of technology and creativity for upper elementary children. Furthermore, outside of the museum is one of the best playgrounds in the city. You would never know it is there until you plan visit to Yerba Buena or the CCM.
<br><br>
We hope you enjoy these spots as much as we have. For additional tips, check out a related post on how families can make the most of day trips in the city.

Technology has the power to transform education far beyond the use of screens. Most of the technology we build for AltSchool is invisible when you walk into a classroom. Overall, we use technology in three ways:
<br><br>
1. Help teachers do what they do best - teach. We build digital tools to help teachers develop Personalized Learning Plans and to capture student progress toward them. We also create platforms for efficient classroom administration so teachers have more quality face-to-face time with their students. <br><br>
2. Incorporate parent input and feedback. Parents are important teachers in our students’ lives. To ensure we are always learning from what happens outside the classroom, we build digital tools to support collaboration between teachers, parents and students. <br><br>
3. Make personalized education a reality. Our project-based education approach truly comes alive when supported by carefully curated learning tools. We mentor each student in the use of technology for learning and help them skillfully navigate today's information terrain. <br><br>

We believe that education can and should get better over time. To this end, we engage in many types of research at AltSchool, including: 
<br><br>

Human-Centered Design: <br><br>
AltSchool is committed to a human-centered design approach that continually improves the educational experience. 
<br><br>
AltSchool's engineers and designers regularly collect feedback from families, educators, and students to see what's working and what needs to be improved. <br><br>
We use cognitive walkthroughs and usability studies to test new processes and technology before we introduce them to the classroom and continue to collect feedback on an ongoing basis for future iterations. 
<br><br>
Read about an example of human-centered design research with parents and one way students employ this type of research in the classroom. <br><br>






Best Practices in Education: AltSchool has a resident team of Ph.D. researchers and a network of research assistants from top-level graduate programs to stay abreast of, and build upon, best practices in the field. We are constantly reviewing literature and updating our database of relevant studies to inform our own practices and identify areas for innovation. 
<br><br>
Check out a recommended reading list of exceptional books that inform our educational philosophy and approach. 

<br><br>



Learning Lab Research: <br><br>
AltSchool trains and empowers our teachers to conduct classroom research to improve learning outcomes. Our teachers observe, reflect, and raise questions about their teaching and their students' learning. 
<br><br>
Teachers also work with our internal research team to design classroom studies and analyze data that will improve student achievement within our micro-school network.

	<b><a name="T20">Design Thinking for the Young Innovator: A Photo Essay</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	

Posted by Sarah Rothenberg and Mitzi Mapa Contes <br><br>

Jul 22, 2015   <br><br>


What does it mean for a 5-year old to build a prototype? Or how about conduct “user research” to inform her creations?
 <br><br>
Design thinking is increasingly becoming more en vogue as a teaching tool in the classroom, but often times teachers introduce it to older students: middle schoolers and up. The truth is, the design approach is valuable for even the youngest ages! Children love to build and tinker, and design thinking helps structure their creativity, while developing additional communication skills in the process.<br><br>


We just finished our second summer session of Design Thinking Maker Lab for Lower Elementary at AltSchool, where lower elementary students, ages 5-7, explored the five stages of design thinking as a way to develop their own projects. From building empathy to learning the fun of iteration, students both worked on themselves and a process to develop their projects.<br><br>

From the eyes of our students, here are three core takeaways and skills young students learn through exploring the design-thinking process from beginning to end.<br><br>

1. Building empathy and communication skills<br><br>

Design thinking in an early childhood classroom is about building connections with each other and the environment. The beginning of the design process― building empathy― helps students connect with people, understand, and define their needs. How can you design something that one, two, or many people can use? In line with the design process, we start with interviews to deeply understand the people (or creatures) for whom you want to build your product, and then move to defining what those possible solutions could be. For example, after learning that his partner like to swim, one student decided to design and prototype a pair of goggles. <br><br>
2. Prototyping, testing, failing, and iterating<br><br>

Design thinking is all about celebrating failure and iteration, because that means you’re yet another step closer to a working solution! Built into the design process is an infinite loop of prototyping and testing. Failing in a safe setting helps teach a healthy growth mindset: students can derive learnings from their mistakes, instead of worrying about a perfect performance.<br><br>
3. Taking pride in the process, not the product  <br><br>

At the end of camp, kids don’t take home the perfect boat or lighthouse. Instead, they’ve learned that by experimenting with 10 types of materials and 15 types of adhesive, they finally got a boat that floats or a lighthouse that actually lights up. This way their final products also embody a series of learnings and growth, which is even evident in the way they describe their creations. The process of building empathy, discovering, tinkering, and iterating removes pressure on performance, and instead emphasizes hard work and determination. Ultimately, it’s a healthy process they can apply towards a variety of projects and challenges.<br><br>

DayTrip1With summer approaching, many families will venture to zoos, parks, and museums for fun experiences in the city with their children. <br><br>

Taking your kids out to explore the city is all about helping them make connections to the real-world. These are valuable opportunities to ignite children’s passions and curiosities, as well as increase cognitive and critical thinking skills in children. 
<br><br>
So how can you make the most out of day trips with the kids? <br><br>

We recently asked AltSchool teachers for tips on how to create high-quality experiences that help children grow in new ways. <br><br>

Here's what they had to share: <br><br>
 
1. Choose an experience that is connected to your child’s interests: Many of the trips we took this past year emerged from our students’ curiosities and passions. For example, one of our younger students developed a passion for boats -  which then led to a curiosity of how food travels in boats. The desire to learn more about how food is distributed led to a trip to Good Eggs, a sustainable food delivery service located one block away from the Dogpatch classroom. Keep in mind, a day trip does not necessarily mean visiting a museum or science center. Sometimes even a trip to a grocery store or food delivery service can be highly educational for children.
<br><br>
2. Preview the Experience:  If possible, map out the visit. Call ahead to find out what types of learning opportunities are available. Scope out the schedule to see what workshops or activities might benefit your child most. Then, preview the experience with your child. In a trip to the Diego Rivera Museum, our teachers pulled up one of Rivera’s murals online and engaged the children in a discussion about its meaning. When children witnessed the mural in person, they experienced a strong, meaningful connection to the painting’s characters and emotions.
<br><br>
3. Follow Your Child’s Lead and Ask Questions:  Let your child enjoy the experience at their own pace and in their own way. Be ready to discuss any questions that arise. If you don’t know the answer, write the questions down or record your child’s questions as a voice memo on your phone. Returning to these questions later is a great way to continue the learning experience at home.
<br><br>
4. Play Games: Games engage children and increase their motivation to learn. So why not make a game of your experience? For a lesson on early American history, our K-1 class ventured to the Ferry Building Farmer’s Market to go on a scavenger hunt to find food items served at the first Thanksgiving meal. Children took photos of each item with their iPad camera and compared notes with each other afterwards. For more ideas, the Smithsonian has a list of learning games suitable for a museum visit.
<br><br>
5. Continue the Learning at Home: Consider ways for your child to recreate the experience at home - whether through an art project, science experiment, or media project. Return to the questions your child brought up and investigate answers together. Post-trip discussions often lead to the planning of your next trip to continue exploring the treasures of the city together.<br><br>

In our second installment of this series, we provide teachers’ recommendations on the top places to take children to learn in the city. <br><br>

	<b><a name="T23">Healthy Eating for Better Learning</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Jan 16, 2014 <br><br> 


Raising children with healthy eating habits is not just about keeping them physically well.
 <br><br>
Nutrition is key for learning.<br><br>

Neuroscience has unequivocally shown that nutrition affects cognitive development. What children eat affects their mental abilities.<br><br>

And is vision really improved with carrot consumption? The study, “Healthy Students are Better Learners,” reveals that proper nutrition enhances vision, motor skills, language, and even social abilities in children.
<br><br>
In our classroom, we regularly nurture healthy eating habits for strong bodies and minds. Below, AltSchool teacher Lauren Hancock highlights ways parents can help their children make smart food choices at home:
<br><br>
3 Tips for Raising Healthy Eaters<br><br>

--Cooking projects: Cooking with your child is an excellent way to encourage healthy eating. AltSchool students cook a nutritious meal together in the classroom every week. Next time you feel inspired, cook a brightly colored meal with your child -- kabobs, stir-fry, or homemade veggie pizza, for example -- and show them how to prepare foods using less fat and pre-packaged ingredients.<br><br>


--Fresh produce delivery: Order a produce box from a weekly delivery service to expand healthy eating possibilities. AltSchool orders sustainable, locally-sourced produce and snacks from Good Eggs. Each week, students select items for their classroom order (favorites include mandarin oranges, avocados, and apples) and open the delivery box together. 
<br><br>

--Healthy snacks: Anticipate your child’s hunger by placing healthy snack options in visible areas. In our classroom, we cut up fruits and veggies and place them on small plates for children to snack on throughout the day. You’ll be surprised to find your children munching on broccoli crudite or cherry tomatoes when they are readily available.

	<b><a name="T24">Tablets and Tweens: How to Guide Your Child in Smart Use</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

shutterstock_141207379What is the best way to help children develop socially as tablet users? 
<br><br>
On the one hand, we want to give our children the space to explore and learn on their own with tablets.
<br><br>
On the other hand, it is helpful to remember that children need guidance in navigating the online world - particularly as they become middle schoolers. 
<br><br>
How can you guide your tween in smart device use? 
<br><br>
Dr. Christine Carter, author of Raising Happiness, says that children in their tweens may be tech-savvy, but they do not yet have the social skills to make their own way in the sophisticated social media world. <br><br>
Carter writes: 
<br><br>
"Middle schoolers are not old enough (or developmentally ready) to have as much freedom online as they often do these days. Think of these devices like cars: Before kids can drive them alone, they need to know the rules. They need clear roads with bright lines painted for them to show them where―and where not―to go."<br><br>

Carter offers parents sound tips to create an environment for responsible tablet use. They include guidelines for: <br><br>
--Spaces - Living room and kitchen are great. Bathroom and car? Not so great. <br><br>
--Times - Afterschool for play and homework. Not during meals and bedtimes. <br><br>
--Content - Clarify what is private and what is not.<br><br>
Carter provides more detailed tips in Tablet and SmartPhone BootCamp for Middle School Parents.<br><br>

	<b><a name="T25">How to Shop for Toys that Teach</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

JohnnycircuitsresizedYou’ve seen their lists - you’ve checked them twice… 
<br><br>
And yet you STILL can’t bring yourself to order up the latest Nerf Blaster or Disney princess, can you?
 <br><br>
The good news? There are some great finds out there that will make your children merry...and bright. 
<br><br>
The best toys offer more than just entertainment. They can be valuable learning opportunities that build communication skills, hand-eye coordination, problem-solving and creative thinking. 
<br><br>
We asked one of our teachers, Lauren Hancock, for helpful advice for parents who want to choose holiday-worthy toys that will help their children grow and develop.
<br><br>
Lauren’s tips? Focus on:
<br><br>
--Interests: Evaluate toys related to areas that your child loves. 
<br><br>

--Abilities: Choose a toy that matches your child’s current ability and can grow with your child over time.
<br><br>

--Open-ended experiences: Look for toys that have multiple uses and no “end.”
<br><br>

--Transfer of knowledge: Find toys that teach skills that transfer to other areas. 
<br><br>

As an example, Lauren recently brought the game Snap Circuits to our Dogpatch classroom. Snap Circuits is a kit with multiple electronic parts, including a peg board and button-snap connectors. It is designed for a wide age group (“from 8 to 108”) and enables children to build all kinds of fun projects such as radios, doorbells, and dancing lights. 
<br><br>
Lauren played Snap Circuits with both younger and older children.  With both age groups, she made sure that they had free time to just “mess about” with the components. Instead of starting with instructions, she gave children unstructured play with new materials so they can engage in the the discovery process on their own. 
<br><br>
With the younger children, Lauren first brought out only a few of the components.“Don’t just throw out all the pieces,” she explains. “Start them off small -  the battery,  a couple of the connectors, and something that glows.” From there, she helps them understand how the basic components work together.
<br><br>
One of the younger students, a 5-year-old, is already interested in building a more advanced project - connecting the circuits with an Ipad to produce dancing lights. Lauren likes Snap Circuits because it enables this type of skill-building over the long-term. 
<br><br>
“He may not be able to get it right now, but he eventually will,” she says. 
<br><br>
Lauren also appreciates the social skills that children learn with this toy. She noticed that some students who have mastered basic circuits are already teaching their peers these skills. “Children learn to be experts and are excited to show others,” she explains.

	<b><a name="T26">3 Ways to Cultivate Gratitude in Your Children</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Posted by Shannon Arvizu, Ph.D. <br><br>

Nov 25, 2013 <br><br> 
Thanksgiving is a wonderful time to ask children why they are grateful. So why not practice the art of appreciation once the turkey is gone...and all year long? <br><br>
 
Instilling grateful feelings now benefits your child for a lifetime. Research shows that children who learn the art of appreciation:<br><br>

--are more optimistic, <br><br>


--have negative emotions less often,  <br><br>


--and are more likely to demonstrate grateful behavior.<br><br>


While these outcomes sound ideal, it's important to keep in mind that gratitude does not usually come naturally to children. <br><br>

As the author of Attitudes of Gratitude, Mary Jane Ryan, states:
<br><br>
“No one is born grateful...Recognizing that someone has gone out of the way for you is not a natural behavior for children -- it’s learned.” <br><br>

So how can we help children adopt gratitude as a regular practice? <br><br>

Here are three ways:<br><br>

1. Play the Gratitude Game: One of our parents, Alice Shikina, plays the “gratitude game” with her children on a daily basis. The gratitude game is simple. Each family member states at least one thing that they are grateful for on that day.
<br><br>
2. Keep a Gratitude Photojournal: Have children take pictures of things for which they are grateful. Organize the photos in a digital folder and update it regularly. If your children are having a bad day, they can watch a slideshow of the things they love so they are reminded of what makes them thankful.
<br><br>
3. Create a Thankful Tablecloth: Get fabric pens and a piece of fabric big enough for your dinner table. Before serving dinner, have each person write or draw the things for which they are grateful. Periodically switch out your normal tablecloth for your thankful tablecloth to bring back those warm, grateful feelings.
<br><br>
Through these simple gratitude practices, you help your children build healthy social and emotional skills that prepare them for a well-balanced adulthood.
<br><br>
And remember, grateful kids are happy kids. 
<br><br>
