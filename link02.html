“What’s your super power?”  “What’s your favorite thing about school?” “What’s your favorite thing to do outside?”
 <br><br>
AltSchool recently hosted a welcome day for both incoming and currently enrolled families in the Bay Area. The day was jam-packed with fun activities; from potato sack races to a brainstorming session to answer questions on post-it notes like the ones above. We had the opportunity to connect as one large AltSchool family.

The Many Meanings of Community 
<br><br>
Schools are more than just classrooms ― they’re the starting point for communities of people who share values and experiences centered on growth and learning. School-based communities spur strong personal relationships that often last for years, as children and families grow together during their time in school and beyond graduation. With this in mind, AltSchool aims to foster a community that grows over time and across multiple relationships, including parents, students, families, friends, teachers, AltSchool employees, and the neighborhoods where AltSchool campuses are located.
<br><br>
AltSchool’s network and microschool structure allows us to build community at multiple levels ― whether it’s a family maker event at a particular site or network-wide town hall. And with a deep focus on personalization, we look for ways that we can connect families according to their specific interests and skills.
<br><br>
Here are some of ways we foster community at AltSchool:
<br><br>
Town Halls: Every month AltSchool hosts a town hall for parents to come together and discuss an array of topics ranging from parent education strategies (e.g., how to continue your child's learning at home or how to prepare for high school), AltSchool’s approaches to curriculum, and new product releases for parents.
<br><br>
Online Communities: Each AltSchool class has an online community where educators and parents share everything from upcoming student performances, to art projects completed in class, to photos and insights from the most recent field trip.
<br><br>
Regular Field Trips: AltSchool classes take students on exciting field trips across the city that give them opportunities to connect with the wider community. Recent expeditions include the Exploratorium, the San Francisco Zoo, California Academy of Science and the Yerba Buena Ice Skating Center.
<br><br>
Family Maker Events: Maker events provide opportunities for educators, parents, and students to collaborate through building, tinkering, and learning together.<br><br>
Parent Volunteer Programs: At AltSchool, we build personalization not only into the student experience, but into the parent experience as well. Families are encouraged to share their time and resources in the ways that are most meaningful to them, from planning get-togethers, to welcoming and mentoring new families, to volunteering in the classroom as experts in their fields. <br><br>

Having a strong community means a more engaging and vibrant educational experience. We encourage all family members to share their unique gifts and interests ― contact us at community@altschool.com to learn more and let us know how you would like to contribute!<br><br>
