	<b><a name="T1">What is AltSchool?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool is a collaborative network of micro-schools that uses outstanding teachers, deep research and innovative tools to offer a personalized, whole child learning experience for the next generation.

Max Ventilla开发的 AltSchool个性化教育模型 ，包括定制化的教育硬件和软件息 ，并且该系统可大规模复制到美国或其他地方。
<br><br>
Max Ventilla是谷歌前高管。在AltSchool之前，文迪拉（Max Ventilla）曾创办过搜索初创公司Aardvark，2010年时卖给了谷歌，并加盟了，就是后来Gooogle+。
<br><br>

当他想在旧金山为女儿找一所小学的时候，发现大部分教学模式仍然是灌输式的，比较个性化的学校又十分昂贵，而且数量很少。
<br><br>
他认为美国的教育完全没有跟上经济的发展，因而决心改变现状。也许Max Ventilla颠覆教育的最初动力来自他自己的孩子，用技术手段帮助孩子自我学习、自由探索，这才是未来的～
<br><br>
他就离开谷歌，决定颠覆一下美国失败的教育体系，重新创业。
<br><br>

于是2013年，他创建了个性化教学培训学校AltSchool……AltSchool目的打造个性化教育模型，开发定制化的教育硬件和软件，并且可大规模复制到其他国家。AltSchool的定位是B-corp企业，不仅仅为了盈利，更要为了社会的发展做出贡献。
B Corps are a new type of company that uses the power of business to solve social and environmental problems.

	<b><a name="T2">What makes AltSchool unique?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

At each of our schools, we listen and adapt to the specific needs of our students, teachers and parents. We develop Personalized Learning Plans to cultivate each child academically, socially and emotionally. To that end, we work with partners in the community to offer a <b>holistic experience</b> that takes advantage of the best people and places that surrounding neighborhoods have to offer. All of this is made possible through the AltSchool supporting network, which works continuously to drive true innovation in education.

	<b><a name="T3">What is a micro-school?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool micro-schools are small learning communities with approximately 80-150 students. Students of mixed ages are divided among several classrooms, and each classroom has a low student to teacher ratio. Because of their small size, micro-schools are flexible in adapting to the needs of teachers, parents, and students.

	<b><a name="T4">Why build a network?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool is built on a scalable framework of centralized resources including product development, engineering, operations and human resources. <br><br>
Through collaboration and innovation, our schools improve as they grow, while still maintaining a warm, small-school environment at each location. Every student’s experience improves as additional students are added to the network because as we try new ideas in our classrooms, we share best practices across the network.<br><br> 

Since we opened in 2013, we’ve expanded from 1 to 4 schools, with more opening in the Fall both in San Francisco, CA as well as Palo Alto, CA and Brooklyn, NY. As our micro-school network grows from hundreds to thousands of enrolled students in the years to come, AltSchool will transform to provide a continuously higher quality learning experience for all.

	<b><a name="T6">How are you funded?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool is privately funded by venture and philanthropic sources. Our funding gives us the resources and flexibility to build an alternative school system that can quickly scale to serve increasing numbers of families. AltSchool's corporate functions, including technology R&D and school system operations, are funded by venture sources. AltSchool campuses, including teacher salaries and campus operations, are funded by tuition. Philanthropy and other resources fund tuition assistance.

	<b><a name="T9">What are school hours?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We understand that flexibility is important for families. Families can drop off their children at school anytime between 8:00am and 9:00am for no additional fee. The school day ends at 3:15 for lower and upper elementary and 3:30pm for middle school. If your child has special scheduling needs beyond this flexible schedule, we’re happy to work with you to try to accommodate them.

	<b><a name="T10">Is after-school care 托管班 available?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We offer co-curricular programs (AltExplore, seasonal sessions, and academic focus) at each of our locations from the end of the school day through 6pm daily.<br><br>

Families do not need to sign up in advance for AltExplore and students may join as needed or in combination with other co-curricular offerings. The program is designed to support children’s need for unstructured play and exploration. Supervised by AltSchool educators, activities may include free-choice or Playlist time, outdoor play, as well as collaborative science, art, or tinkering projects depending on student interest. The cost for the 2015-16 school year is $12 per hour.
<br><br>
AltSchool’s seasonal co-curricular sessions are taught by specialists and run for 10-14 weeks, allowing students to explore new subjects, dig deeper into their existing passions and interests, and build on previous experiences. These programs take place before school during the 8-9am drop-off window and after school through 6pm. Content is determined at each site based on family preferences and educator availability, but may include coursework in foreign language, performing arts, sports, environmental education, STEM, and visual arts.
<br><br>
These co-curricular programs offer families a wide range of choices to truly personalize a student’s day. Content is tailored to each group’s interest and abilities, and children can form meaningful relationships with peers from other classrooms and AltSchool sites.
<br><br>
In most cases, a minimum number of enrolled students will be required for a program to move forward. Pricing depends on the offering, as well as on meeting frequency (once to multiple times a week), but ranges from $100-$500 per month. 
<br><br>
For families looking for individualized support with an academic focus, AltSchool offers one-on-one or small-group sessions with members of the education support team. Families can also schedule blocks of time for external support providers to work with individual or small groups of students.
