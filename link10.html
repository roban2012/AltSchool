It’s one of those (rare) sunny, blue-skied days in San Francisco, and my lower elementary class gallops outside for recess. This time, however, it’s not for long! After only a few minutes outside, several students excitedly run to me, out of breath, and beg “Kelly, can we please go inside to work on our reading project!?”
 <br><br>
You heard that right: kindergarten and 1st grade students wanted to forgo recess to read. In all of my eight years of teaching, I have never seen such a high level of student engagement when it came to reading. For most of us educators, students tend to resist reading lessons when they’re challenging, and especially when those lessons follow recess.
<br><br>
I had to ask myself ― why do my students suddenly want to stop free play to work on their reading? What is making them so engaged?<br><br>

The magic of interest-driven learning
<br><br>
Our class was in the middle of an interest-driven project― a type of learning methodology in which students drive their own learning journeys. And this time round, we were working on a Reader’s Theater, in which the class imagined, wrote, and eventually performed an original play in front of their families.
<br><br>
Turning play into valuable learning experiences
<br><br>
Many interest-driven projects start with observation; the teacher’s role, in this case, is to investigate student interests, and by teasing out these interests through a project, guide children in a process of self-discovery. For example, during recess I saw that many students loved to create elaborate storylines among their friends, each with unique characters, and act out a scene throughout recess. Recognizing the class was full of natural playwrights, improvisers, and actors, I thought to incorporate their interests into our reading lessons.This way, students feel like school is free play, hardly realizing they’re learning at the same time. 
<br><br>
Screen_Shot_2015-06-03_at_1.51.43_PMAfter brainstorming a story for a play as a class― a triumphant tale involving vegimals, kitty cats, and telling time, I wrote a script for the play integrating their ideas with critical sight words and phonetic skills. What emerged was a progression of lessons with high student engagement, while developing essential math skills of telling time, and foundational reading skills of reading fluently with expression.  
<br><br>
The resulting energy and engagement was tangible throughout the class, not to mention sustained through many weeks of pulling together this production. Throughout this student-driven project, I was continually amazed by the depth of student engagement and learning, from taking ownership to developing grit. Here are five skills I was delighted to see the students develop in the four-week unit.  
<br><br>
1. Ownership: “We have to practice our lines!”
<br><br>
The students were the drivers in creating the story and producing the play from start to finish. It’s often the teacher’s role to remind students to rehearse and prepare; however, I regularly heard students reminding each other and themselves about what was needed for the big performance. “We need to practice our lines today,” or “we need to make our costumes,” communicated the natural ownership, pride, and excitement students had for their production.
<br><br>
2. Teamwork: “I know, let’s have both vegimals and students!”
<br><br>
Screen_Shot_2015-06-03_at_1.52.11_PMThroughout the entire process from reading and practicing, to making costumes and performing,students had different (read: strong) ideas about various elements of their production. Together, they had to solve problems and compromise in order to create a unified production. For example, at one point a deepening chasm seemed to emerge, dividing the class into two distinct camps: one side wanted the story to be about vegimals, and the other was set on a class of students. At last one student shouted: “I know, let’s have both the vegimals and kitty cats be teacher pets!” Differences were allied, and off we went.
<br><br>
3. Creativity and Imagination: “Time to make our costumes! I want to make a hat with a clock on it.” 
<br><br>
The sky was the limit for this project. Student creativity and imagination flowed through every aspect of this project, from coming up with the storyline (no teacher, for example, would have come up with a vegimal- and kitty cat-centered plot) to making costumes, and acting out the performance.
<br><br>
4. Depth of Experience: “When do we get to practice our show?”
<br><br>
Students at this age, no matter how interested they are, often lose interest once the novelty of a project has worn off, but not this project. After two weeks of developing the story, students started to ask: “when do we get to practice!?” It was remarkable to see students still so engaged after four solid weeks.
<br><br>
5. Grit & Entrepreneurship: “I’ll change my my voice to act like my character.”
<br><br>

<br><br>
Managing the process from end to end― from conception to production― is an incredibly entrepreneurial activity. Each component required something new from each student, whether that be rehearsing lines to building a set.
 <br><br>
The level of engagement and scope of the project also pushed their reading abilities. Reading with expression is difficult for students in lower elementary, and when faced with this challenge students showed determination to learn to read these difficult words and persevered. Some even took a step further to change the tone to embody their character’s voice.
<br><br>
And finally, the students put on an incredible performance for their parents that reflected weeks of practice, perseverance, originality, and teamwork. Not to mention, their final product inspired a standing ovation and some pretty proud parents.
