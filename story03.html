	<hr><br>
	
When a child joins AltSchool, we create a Learner Portrait for him or her. The Learner Portrait catalogs interests, passions, strengths, opportunities, and learning strategies that work best. It also reflects where the student currently is on the continuum of learner objectives that we have set for all AltSchool students and is continually updated over time. Based on the Learner Portrait and global AltSchool Learning Objectives, our educators (in collaboration with family and students) create a <b>Personalized Learning Plan (PLP)</b>. The PLP is reviewed quarterly and informs the playlist activities a student sees each week. Once goals are mastered, educators set new goals for the student.

	<b><a name="T2">What is an AltSchool <b>Playlist</b></a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>

The AltSchool Playlist is a personalized set of activities for a student to complete, usually on a weekly basis. It includes basic assignments, individual, small group and whole class assignment, links to external learning resources to be integrated into the student’s curriculum, and much more. Playlist time begins with our youngest students and increases as students progress through AltSchool.

	<b><a name="T3">What role do standards play at AltSchool?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool’s learning objectives draw from a variety of standards and metrics as a framework for instructional design. Our elementary and middle school instruction is informed by the Common Core, National Council of the Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM), Next Generation Science Standards, International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE), Partnership for 21st Century Skills, and the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), among others.

	<b><a name="T4">What co-curricular experiences do you offer?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
As part of the school day, students get an interdisciplinary curriculum that includes the visual and performing arts, STEM, physical fitness, and outdoor and experiential learning. Before and after school, AltSchool also offers for an additional fee a wide range of co-curricular programs for families to personalize to fit their needs. These offerings include art, music, athletics, tinkering, and foreign language, as well as our drop-in AltExplore program and time for independent study or one-on-one tutoring and support. We personalize co-curricular offerings at each location based on student and parent preferences, as well as community availability. These programs are regularly adjusted based on feedback. Where possible, co-curriculars are integrated into students’ work during the school day.

Families receive regular updates on student progress based on playlist and project-based learning activities, student and teacher reflections, portfolio work, and adaptive-standardized tests. Teachers also hold parent/teacher conferences throughout the year.

	<hr><br>
	
Our co-curricular programs before and after school are offered for an additional fee and include foreign language instruction for all ages and levels in Mandarin and Spanish. In the past, AltSchool has partnered with organizations such as Education Francaise Bay Area to provide interested students an opportunity to study other languages that do not have the demand for a full AltSchool class.

	<b><a name="T7">Do you give grades?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Frequent feedback is key to improving student outcomes over time. AltSchool students regularly receive both qualitative and quantitative feedback.<br><br>

Every week, students, teachers, and family members reflect on the design and outcomes of each student’s Personalized Learning Plan and adjust learning Playlists accordingly. On a regular basis, students, teachers, and family members meet for an in-person consultation to review and improve the learning plan based on collective observations and evaluations of student work. In addition, each student has a portfolio of work to demonstrate project-based learning outcomes.<br><br>

For quantitative measurement, we integrate real-time, games-based adaptive learning applications in the classroom. This way, students are motivated to improve within the context of the learning experience.
<br><br>
In addition, AltSchool students are assessed three times per year on the Measure of Academic Progress (MAP). MAP is an adaptive test based on Common Core Standards that matches each student’s skill level. Parents and teachers will be able to benchmark a child’s grade level for each subject, including percentile ranking and range of growth.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T8">What is your policy on homework?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
AltSchool does not have a formal homework policy and it varies from child to child. This depends on age, skill level and how successful each child is in managing time to complete work in class. <br><br>

When elementary students bring home school work, it is usually to complete a project or to dive deeper into topics driven by passion and interest. Because reading assignments and written work become lengthier as the student matures, Middle Schoolers regularly have homework in order to maximize instructional time. However, students can often finish their work during individual Playlist time built into the schedule every day.

	<b><a name="T9">Who is the principal?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our classrooms are designed for participatory leadership rather than top-down control. Each micro-school classroom is run by a Head of School who collaborates with co-teachers, parents and students to shape vision, determine priorities, and solve problems.<br><br>

Other functions typically assigned to school administrators -- including recruiting, outreach, technology support, purchasing, and finances -- are handled by AltSchool’s support team and academic advisory board.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T10">Why do you have mixed ages?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
We believe that, like adults, children benefit educationally and socially from being part of diverse communities with a range of ages and abilities. Grouping children of various ages together gives each child exposure to peers who are similar and different. Children learn from one another as they stretch to attain higher levels of understanding and as they serve as experts to those less far along. Each student has a personalized education plan and we have a low classroom student to teacher ratio, thus we can effectively serve children at multiple grade levels in the same homeroom environment.

	<b><a name="T11">How are student needs met in a micro-school campus?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Our micro-schools are composed of flexible classroom spaces that work as multi-disciplinary learning centers. An open floor plan, modular furniture and state of the art learning tools allow us to easily shift room functions--quickly transforming a room from a science laboratory to a reading lounge to a yoga studio. In addition, students make frequent use of neighborhood facilities such as yoga studios, gyms, science institutions, libraries, museums, parks, and other enrichment centers in the city.

	<br>
	<b><a name="T13">How are you using technology?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
Most technology is invisible in the classroom. Student-facing technology complements but never replaces the relationship with the teacher. We use technology to superpower our teachers and improve the quality of time spent with each student. We use technology in three ways: <br><br>

1. We help teachers do what they do best: teach. We are building digital platforms to streamline the backend operations of the classroom so teachers can spend more time in face-to-face interactions with students.<br><br>
 2. Understanding that parent input and feedback are key to every student’s education, we are building digital tools to support communications and collaboration between teachers, parents, and students.<br><br>
 3. We complement our interactive, project-based approach with digital learning tools carefully curated by our educators as part of a student’s personalized learning plan. We mentor each student’s use of technology.<br><br>

Technology in the classroom varies by program. With younger children technology is used mainly for chronicling students work and to provide communication between parents and educators. A younger student might use technology to take a picture of an activity to chronicle it, provide feedback on a project, or create a video for a story she has written. For older students, technology is integrated throughout their curriculum as appropriate, and they leverage it to augment learning and accomplish their overall learning objectives. Each student has their own iPad or Chromebook to manage their playlist learning.

	<b><a name="T14">What kind of child does AltSchool look for?</a> </b><br>
	<hr><br>
	
There is no single perfect type of student for AltSchool. We look for children with a combination of skills, talents, interests, and learning styles. We also look for children with a combination of curiosity, enthusiasm, and optimism. We consider these elements when putting together our classrooms. We aim to attract students who complement one another and help each other grow. Because we provide personalized learning experiences and we have multiple locations and school environments, we are an ideal educational environment for a wide range of personality types and learner profiles.

Rather than ranking students and admitting our top choices to a limited number of spots, we craft ideally balanced classes through a careful understanding of students and families. We have the capacity to open new micro-schools where there is the greatest interest and demand amongst prospective families.
